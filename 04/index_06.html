      <h3>Experimental System and Feeding</h3>
      <p>Healthy juvenile P. monodon tested negative forwhite spot syndrome virus were
      obtained from a shrimp farm (South 24 Parganas, West Bengal, India). Shrimpswere
      acclimatized for 14 days and fedwith commercial diet (40% crude protein) three
      times daily before start of experiment. </p>
      <p>The experimentwas conducted in triplicate in FRP tanks (1000 L; bottom area 2
      m2) filled with chlorine free brackishwater. Two hundred and fifty two P.
      monodon juveniles (2.9 Â± 0.10 g) were randomly distributed in the four
      experimental groups at 21 nos. tank&#8722;1 following a completely randomized design
      (CRD). </p>
      <p>The daily feeding was done at 6.5% of the body weight at the start of
      experiment and declined gradually to 4.5% of body weight at the end of the
      experiment. The daily ration was divided in to two parts, 40% feed was given in
      themorning and 60% in the evening. </p>
      <p>Equal amount of feed was fed to shrimps in all the experimental tanks, twice
      daily at 10:00 and 18.00 h for 60 days. Left over feed and fecal matter were
      removed daily and 25% water was exchanged every 3rd day.</p>
