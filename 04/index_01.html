      <h3>Effect of Dietary Supplementation of Biofloc on Growth Performance
        and Digestive Enzyme Activities in Penaeus Monodon</h3>
      <p>Penaeid shrimps are highly valued seafood commodity in domestic and
      international markets. Economics of shrimp farming is largely dependent on the
      feed which constitutes 40â€“60% operational expenses (Tan et al., 2005). </p>
      <p>Dietary supplements are widely used in shrimp culture to enhance the growth,
      immune response and digestive enzyme activities. </p>
      <p>Commonly used dietary supplements in penaeid shrimp are microalgal products
      (Boonyaratpalin et al., 2001; Ju et al., 2009; Supamattaya et al., 2005),
      macroalgae (Yeh et al., 2006), probiotics (Wang, 2007; Yang et al., 2010;
      Ziaei-Nejad et al., 2006), prebiotics (Zhang et al., 2012) and periphyton (Anand
      et al., 2013b). </p>
      <p>Recently, manipulation of carbon nitrogen ratio (C:N ratio) for development
      of biofloc has shown promise in aquaculture (Anand et al., 2013a; Avnimelech,
      1999). </p>
      <p>The C:N ratio is manipulated by supplementation of external carbon source or
      elevated carbon level in the feed (Ballester et al., 2010; Crab et al., 2012;
      McIntosh, 2000). </p>
      <p>At high C:N ratio, heterotrophic bacteria immobilize the ammonium ion for
      production of microbial protein and maintain inorganic nitrogen level within the
      limit (Avnimelech, 1999). </p>
      <p>Biofloc enhances the growth performance of Penaeus monodon (Anand et al.,
      2013a; Arnold et al., 2009; Hari et al., 2006), Litopenaeus vannamei (Wasielesky
      et al., 2006; Xu and Pan, 2012), Farfantepenaeuspaulensis (Ballester et al.,
      2010) and Marsupenaeus japonicus (Zhao et al., 2012). </p>
      <p>Apart from being a source of quality proteins, bioflocs are rich source of
      growth promoters and bioactive compounds (Ju et al., 2008a) which enhance
      digestive enzymes (Xu and Pan, 2012) and health status of the cultured shrimps
      (Singh et al., 2005). </p>
      <p>In general, most research makes use of in situ developed microbial floc for
      growth performance of shrimp (Hari et al., 2006; Xu and Pan, 2012). </p>
      <p>However, these in situ based techniques need additional oxygen demands for
      microbial respiration, in addition to the oxygen demand of shrimp (Burford et
      al., 2003; Tacon et al., 2002). </p>
      <p>This added oxygen demand requires additional aerators, which increases the
      aeration expenses in shrimp farms compared to conventional shrimp culture
      systems (Tacon et al., 2002). </p>
      <p>Moreover, increased production of microbial floc particle is also a matter of
      challenge if production exceeds consumption by shrimp. Recently, it has been
      demonstrated that dietary inclusion of biofloc enhanced the growth performance
      of L. vannamei (Bauer et al., 2012; Ju et al., 2008b; Kuhn et al., 2010). </p>
      <p>However, there is a dearth of information to support the dietary role of
      biofloc on growth and digestive enzyme activity in P. monodon. Hence, to
      investigate the suitability of biofloc as a dietary supplement, biofloc produced
      in indoor FRP tanks was included in shrimp diet at different level and fed to P.
      monodon. </p>
      <p>In this context, the present study aims to evaluate the effect of dietary
      supplementation of biofloc on growth performance and digestive enzyme activities
      in P. monodon juveniles.</p>
