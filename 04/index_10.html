      <h3>Analysis of Digestive Enzymes</h3>
      <p>After completion of the feeding experiment, 18 inter-molt shrimp from each
      treatment groups (6 from each replicate) were sacrificed for digestive enzyme
      analysis. The molt stage was determined by the setal development of the uropod
      using stereomicroscope (Dall et al., 1990). </p>
      <p>The samples were collected 1 h after the last feeding to guarantee maximum
      activity of digestive enzymes. The hepatopancreas and gut of the shrimp were
      dissected out, weighed and homogenized with 0.25 M chilled sucrose on wet basis
      (pH 7, 1:10 w/v) in a hand-held glass homogenizer in ice cooled condition. </p>
      <p>The homogenatewas centrifuged at 6000 rpm (2400 ×g) for 20min at 4 °C
      (Centrifuge 5417R, Eppendorf, Germany). After centrifugation, the floating top
      lipid layer was removed and the supernatant solution was divided as aliquots in
      1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. </p>
      <p>The samples were stored at &#8722;40 °C until analysis. Total soluble protein of
      the homogenate was measured using folin– phenol reagent (Lowry et al., 1951).
      Amylase activity was measured by 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) method (Rick
      and Stegbauer, 1974). </p>
      <p>The reaction mixture consisted 0.1 mL of 1% (w/v) starch solution as
      substrate, 1.8 mL phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7) and 0.1 mL tissue homogenate.
      The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. </p>
      <p>The reaction was stopped by adding 2 mL DNS reagent, and kept in boiling
      water bath for 5 min. The reaction mixture was diluted with distilled water and
      recorded the absorbance at 540 nm. </p>
      <p>Activity was determined from the maltose standard curve and expressed as mole
      of maltose released from starch mg&#8722;1 protein min&#8722;1 at 37 °C. Cellulase activity
      was determined based on Miller (1959). </p>
      <p>The reaction mixture consisted 0.5 mL of 1% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as
      substrate in 1 mL phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 6.8) with 0.5 mL tissue
      homogenate. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. </p>
      <p>The reaction was stopped by adding 3 mL of DNS reagent and the mixture was
      kept in boiling water bath for 10 min. The reaction mixture was diluted with
      distilled water and absorbance was recorded at 574 nm. </p>
      <p>One unit of cellulase activity was defined as number of molecules of glucose
      released from cellulose mg&#8722;1 protein min&#8722;1 at 37 °C.</p>
      <p>Protease activity was determined by the casein digestion method of Drapeau
      (1976). The reaction mixture consisted of 2.5 mL of 1% (w/v) casein prepared in
      0.01 N NAOH, 0.05M tris phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) and 0.1 mLtissue homogenate.</p>
      <p>The reaction mixturewas incubated at 37 °C for 15min. The reaction was
      stopped by adding 2.5mL, 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and the whole content
      were filtered. The reagent blank wasmade by adding tissue homogenate just before
      stopping the reaction andwithout incubation. </p>
      <p>The absorbancewas recorded at 280 nm. The protease activity was determined
      from the tyrosine standard curve and expressed as micromole of tyrosine released
      mg&#8722;1 protein min&#8722;1 at 37 °C. Lipase activity was determined based on Cherry and
      Crandall (1932). </p>
      <p>The reactionmixture consisted of distilledwater, tissue homogenate, phosphate
      buffer (0.1M, pH 7) and olive oil emulsion as substrate and incubated at 27 °C
      for 24 h. Then 95% alcohol and two drops of phenolphthalein indicator were
      added, and titrated against 0.05 N NaOH until the appearance of permanent pink
      color. </p>
      <p>A control with enzyme source is inactivated by keeping for 15min in boiling
      water bath prior to addition of buffer and olive oil emulsion. The
      milliequivalent of alkali consumed was taken as lipase activity.</p>
