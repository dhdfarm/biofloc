      <h3>Discussion</h3>
      <p>Beneficial role of in situ based biofloc system in penaeid shrimp culture are
      well documented (Hari et al., 2006; Xu and Pan, 2012). Recently, it has been
      reported that use of biofloc as a dietary ingredient in shrimp diet enhances the
      growth rate of L. vannamei (Kuhn et al., 2009, 2010). </p>
      <p>The present study illustrates the role of biofloc as a dietary supplement on
      growth performance and digestive enzyme activity in P. monodon. In the present
      study, C:N ratio was maintained at 10:1 to efficiently convert the inorganic
      nitrogen into microbial protein (Avnimelech, 1999). </p>
      <p>Wheat flour was used as carbohydrate source for its easy availability and
      production of good quality floc (Azim and Little, 2008; Ballester et al., 2010).
      In the present experiment, 4.03 ± 0.36 kg wheat flour was used to produce 1 kg
      of microbial flocs. </p>
      <p>Earlier, Kuhn et al. (2009) reported 1 kgmicrobial flocs production from 1.5
      kg of sucrose in a bioreactor. Thismay be because being a disaccharide; sucrose
      is readily available for microbial utilization, while wheat flour has complex
      long chain polysaccharides. </p>
      <p>Even though, bioreactors have better conversion efficiency, the present
      production system is simple and advantageous as it used cheap and readily
      available ammonium sulphate as nitrogen source and wheat flour as carbon source.
      </p>
      <p>Total microbial community in biofloc production system reached a density of
      108 cfu mL&#8722;1 and matches with the earlier findings (Burford et al., 2003). The
      major microbial community developed in the biofloc belonged to Vibrionaceae,
      Bacillus sp., and Lactobacillus sp. with majority as gram negative bacteria. </p>
      <p>Aggregates of particulate organic matter, zooplankton communities like
      ciliates, rotifers and a small amount of autotrophic microalgae were also
      noticed. Similarly, Ballester et al. (2010) reported that biofloc is composed of
      attached heterotrophic bacteria, filamentous cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates,
      ciliates, flagellates and rotifers. </p>
      <p>Various factors like salinity, light and type of culture systemaffects
      themicrobial composition of floc. For example, Ju et al. (2008a) reported the
      dominance of algal communities over bacterial biomass in flocs collected from
      outdoor shrimp culture units. </p>
      <p>Lower dominance of autotrophic community noticed in the present study might
      be due to lack of direct sunlight in the biofloc indoor production facility. The
      presence of diverse group of bacteria especially, Bacillus sp. and Lactobacillus
      sp. indicate that biofloc can be considered as a source of potential probiotics.
      </p>
      <p>Proximate analysis of the biofloc in the present study is in agreement with
      the findings of Ballester et al. (2010) who reported 30.4% crude protein (CP)
      with wheat flour and molasses as carbohydrate sources. </p>
      <p>Nutritional composition of biofloc varies with type of carbohydrate source,
      microbial community structure, culture condition etc. For instance, Crab et al.
      (2010) observed that biofloc developed fromglycerol inoculated with Bacillus
      contained higher protein (58% CP) than biofloc developed fromglycerol, acetate
      (42–43% CP) and glucose (28% CP). </p>
      <p>The lower crude protein level noticed in the harvested biofloc compared to
      earlier findings (Crab et al., 2010; Ekasari et al., 2010)may be due to
      differences in bacteria taking part in floc formation (Rittmann and McCarty,
      2001). </p>
      <p>For example, substrates like acetate and glycerol used in the previous
      studies (Crab et al., 2010)might have promoted the bacteria involved in cellular
      growth and increased the protein content in biofloc whereas wheat flour might
      have promoted bacteria that produce large amounts of exopolysaccharides. </p>
      <p>Ju et al. (2008a) reported that chlorophyll-dominated biofloc contained
      higher crude protein content (42%) than flocs dominated by diatoms (26–34%) and
      bacteria (38%). This further suggests that the microbiota that constitutes the
      biofloc is likely to affect the protein content of the bioflocs. </p>
      <p>In the microbial food web, microalgae and zooplankton are the richer source
      of lipids compared to bacteria (Zhukova and Kharlamenko, 1999). Out of 20 fatty
      acids detected in biofloc, palmitic acid, cis-vaccenic acid, linoleic acid and
      oleic acid were the dominant fatty acids, and omega 3 fatty acids detected in
      trace level. </p>
      <p>This is in consonancewith the findings of Crab et al. (2010) who reported
      that biofloc contain palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid and linoleic acid in the
      highest and omega 3 fatty acids in trace levels. </p>
      <p>The lower level of PUFA in biofloc may be due to the dominance of
      heterotrophic bacteria compared to PUFA rich microalgal community (Meyers and
      Latscha, 1997). Inclusion of biofloc as a dietary ingredient in shrimp diet
      found to improve the growth performance of L. vannamei (Ju et al., 2008b; Kuhn
      et al., 2009, 2010). </p>
      <p>In the present study, dietary supplementation of biofloc at 4 and 8% levels
      significantly enhanced the growth, PER and reduced the FCR in tiger shrimp. </p>
      <p>It has been documented that bioflocs are the rich source of many bioactive
      compounds such as carotenoids, chlorophylls, phytosterols, bromophenols, amino
      sugars (Ju et al., 2008a) and anti-bacterial compounds (Crab et al., 2010). </p>
      <p>This suggests that microbial components, unknown growth factors or probiotic
      microorganisms like Bacillus, Lactobacillus present in the biofloc might have
      resulted in significantly higher growth rate and better FCR in shrimp fed with
      biofloc incorporated diet. </p>
      <p>Biochemical composition of the diet plays an important role in digestive
      enzyme profile in shrimp (Gamboa-Delgado et al., 2003). </p>
      <p>In the present study, dietary supplementation of biofloc significantly
      improved (p b 0.05) the specific activity of digestive enzymes like amylase,
      cellulase, protease and lipase in the treatment groups compared with control.
      </p>
      <p>The increased digestive enzyme activities in B4 and B8 might have enhanced
      the digestion and nutrient absorption which might have contributed significantly
      higher (p b 0.05) growth rate in these treatment groups. </p>
      <p>A previous study by Xu and Pan (2012) in biofloc based system, reported
      significantly higher digestive enzyme activities and better growth performance
      in L. vannamei. </p>
      <p>Similarly, enhanced level of digestive enzymes activity has been reported in
      fish and shrimp fed with probiotics, microalgae and periphyton supplemented
      diets (Anand et al., 2013b; Lara-Flores et al., 2003; Ziaei-Nejad et al., 2006).
      </p>
      <p>The presence of microbial components in the biofloc supplemented diet might
      have stimulated the production of endogenous enzymes by the shrimp
      hepatopancreas compared with control. </p>
      <p>In the present study, the biofloc supplementation at the 12% level (B12) did
      not result in proportionate increase in growth rate or improvement of FCR
      comparedwith control. </p>
      <p>Further, the digestive enzyme activities in B12 were not significantly higher
      than other treatment groups. Earlier, Kuhn et al. (2010) replaced the fish meal
      by biofloc in L. vannamei diet and recorded significantly higher growth rate at
      10 and 15%, and non-significant difference at 21 and 30% dietary inclusion level
      of biofloc. </p>
      <p>The present findings agree in general with those of Wang (2007) and Anand et
      al.(2013b)who reported that increase in dietary supplementation of probiotic or
      periphytic algae in shrimpdiet do not increase proportionately the digestive
      enzymeactivities and growth of shrimp.</p>
      <p>Moreover, reduction in growth rate of fishes was recorded at higher level of
      microbial supplementation (Ajiboye et al., 2012; Kiessling and Askbrandit, 1993)
      as microbial products at higher level tend to reduce the feed palatability and
      digestibility (Kiessling and Askbrandit, 1993). </p>
      <p>The higher ash level recorded in the B12 diet compared to all other groups
      also might have influenced the digestibility and growth performance of shrimp.
      </p>
      <p>However, the growth performance of B12was comparable to control suggesting
      that dietary supplementation of higher level of biofloc do not have growth
      retardation effects in shrimp juveniles. </p>
      <p>Seeing the cost-effectiveness, the inclusion of biofloc at 4% level is
      beneficial in improving growth performance and digestive enzyme activities in
      shrimp.</p>
