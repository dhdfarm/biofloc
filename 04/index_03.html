      <h3>Production of Biofloc</h3>
      <p>Biofloc production was carried out in three indoor fiberglass reinforced
      plastic (FRP) tanks (1000 L; bottom area 2 m2) in seven batches at 5-day
      interval during March to May, 2011. Tanks were filled with water from the nearby
      brackishwater source. </p>
      <p>The fine meshed filter bag was used to prevent entry of unwanted materials
      and suspended particles in to the tanks. Two aeration pipes with air stones and
      regulators with 7.5 m3 air tank&#8722;1 min&#8722;1 diffusing capacity were provided in each
      tank to meet the oxygen demand and proper mixing of floc. </p>
      <p>As an inoculum, 10 L water with bacterial floc developed in a separate tank
      was added to each tank. The C: N ratio was maintained at 10: 1 using ammonium
      sulphate as nitrogen and wheat flour as carbon source. </p>
      <p>Inorganic nitrogen source was applied up to the 3rd day (72 h) while addition
      of carbohydrate was continued till the 4th day. Thiswas done for
      maximumutilization of left over inorganic nitrogen and to reduce the chance of
      occurrence of inorganic nitrogen in the form of total ammonia nitrogen in the
      collected biofloc. </p>
      <p>On the 5th day, biofloc was allowed to settle by closing the aeration and
      subsequently harvested by passing water in nylon filter bag with 10 &#956;m pore
      size. The collected floc centrifuged at 2000 rpm and discarded the supernatant
      water. </p>
      <p>To remove the traces of ammonia nitrogen level, bioflocs were washed twice
      with filtered brackish water of same salinity. Flocs were dried under shade on a
      polythene sheet followed by drying in a hot air oven at 45 Â°C. </p>
      <p>The dried flocs ground in to fine powder (less than 200 &#956;m) and kept in
      airtight containers in refrigerator until experimental diets were made.</p>
