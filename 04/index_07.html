      <h3>Proximate Composition of Biofloc and Experimental Diets</h3>
      <p>The proximate composition of the biofloc and experimental diets were
      determined following the standard methods of AOAC (1995). Themoisture contentwas
      determined by drying at 105 °C to a constant weight, and the difference in
      weight of the sample indicated the moisture content. </p>
      <p>Crude proteinwas estimated by Kjeldahl method (Kelplus, Pelican equipments,
      India). Crude lipid was determined by the solvent extraction method by Soxtec
      system (Soxtec system, SCS–6, Pelican equipments, India) using diethyl ether
      (boiling point, 40–60 °C) as a solvent. </p>
      <p>Ash content was determined by incinerating the samples in a muffle furnace at
      600 °C for 6 h. Crude fiber was determined based on the weight loss on ignition
      of the oven dried residue remaining after sequential digestion of a sample with
      H2SO4 and NaOH solution using Fibretec (Foss Tecator 2022, Sweden). </p>
      <p>Gross energy was determined as per the N.R.C. (1993). Total nitrogen free
      extract (NFE) was determined as per the formula described in Hastings and Dupree
      (1969). </p>
