      <h3>Fatty Acid Profile of Biofloc</h3>
      <p>Total lipids were extracted from biofloc sample according to Folch et al.
      (1957). Fatty acid methyl esters were prepared based on the procedure given in
      AOAC (1995). </p>
      <p>Briefly, the lipid extract was boiled in a condenser with 2 mL methanolic
      NaOH for first 5 min followed by 2mL BF3-methanol for the next 2 min. </p>
      <p>To recover the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) in organic phase, 5 mL heptane
      was added and heated for 8 min, and washed with saturated NaCl solution into a
      separating funnel. The upper FAME layerwas stored in glass vials at 0 °C for
      further analysis in GC–MS. </p>
      <p>The methylated fatty acids were separated using GC–MS (QP2010, Shimadzu, USA)
      equipped with DB Wax (30 m × 0.25mm internal diameter × 0.25 &#956;m film thickness)
      capillary column (Cromlab SA, Spain). </p>
      <p>Helium was used as carrier gas. Injector and detector temperatures were set
      at 250 °C. Injection was performed in split mode (1:15) with an injection volume
      of 1 &#956;l FAME. The initial column temperature wasmaintained at 50 °C for 2 min.
      </p>
      <p>The temperature was set to increase at the rate of 10 °C per minute until the
      final temperature reached 230 °C and kept for 35min. Fatty acid methyl esters
      were separated at a constant pressure of 82.5 KPa. The peakswere identified by
      comparing the mass spectra with the mass spectral data base.</p>
