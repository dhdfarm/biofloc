      <h3>The Use of Bioflocs as a Biocontrol Measure</h3>
      <p>In addition to the advantages of biofloc technology discussed above, Crab et
      al. (2010b) have recently shown that biofloc technology constitutes a possible
      alternative measure to fight pathogenic bacteria in aquaculture. </p>
      <p>Intensive aquaculture of crustaceans is one of the fastest-growing sectors in
      aquaculture production (Wang et al., 2008). Despite its huge success, shrimp
      culture is facing severe outbreaks of infectious diseases, which have caused
      significant economic losses. </p>
      <p>Due to the haphazard mishandling of antibiotics in aquaculture, pathogenic
      bacteria are now becoming resistant to numerous antibiotics and as a result,
      antibiotics are no longer effective in treating bacterial disease (Defoirdt et
      al., 2011). </p>
      <p>The disruption of quorum sensing, bacterial cell-to-cell communication with
      small signal molecules (Defoirdt et al., 2008), has been proposed as a new
      strategy to control bacterial infections in aquaculture as this cell-tocell
      communication mechanism regulates the expression of virulence factors (Defoirdt
      et al., 2004). </p>
      <p>Interestingly, we recently found that bioflocs grown on glycerol were able to
      protect gnotobiotic brine shrimp (Artemia franciscana) against pathogenic Vibrio
      harveyi, and that the beneficial effect was likely due to interference with the
      pathogen's quorum sensing system (Crab et al., 2010b). </p>
      <p>Indeed, survival of challenged nauplii increased 3-fold after the addition of
      live bioflocs. This complies with former research that revealed that primary
      production and promotion of in situ microbial populations, as is the case in
      biofloc technology, were found to be beneficial for shrimp (Lezama-Cervantes and
      Paniagua-Michel, 2010). </p>
      <p>The exact mechanism of the protective action of bioflocs and its selective
      action, however, needs further in-depth investigation. Another interesting
      feature of bioflocs to further investigate with respect to biocontrol effects is
      the capability to accumulate the bacterial storage compound
      poly-&#946;-hydroxybutyrate (PHB). </p>
      <p>PHB and PHB accumulating bacteria have been shown before to protect different
      aquaculture animals from bacterial infections (De Schryver et al., 2010;
      Defoirdt et al., 2007; Dinh et al., 2010; Halet et al., 2007). </p>
      <p>PHB-accumulating bacteria are present in bioflocs as we have measured PHB
      levels in bioflocs of between 0.5 and 18% of the dry matter (Crab, 2010; De
      Schryver and Verstraete, 2009). </p>
      <p>The latter bioflocs contain a sufficient PHB level to protect cultured
      animals from infection by pathogenic bacteria (Halet et al., 2007). Numerous
      researches have noted that shrimp are healthiest and growbest in aquaculture
      systems that have high levels of algae, bacteria and other natural biota (Kuhn
      et al., 2009). </p>
      <p>Probiotics are viable microbial cells that have a beneficial effect on the
      health of a host by improving its intestinal equilibrium through improved feed
      value, enzymatic contribution to digestion, inhibition of pathogenic
      microorganisms, antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic actions, growth-promoting
      factors, and an increased immune response (Verschuere et al., 2000). </p>
      <p>Since several research articles have been published on the benefits of using
      Bacillus to improve shrimp growth performance, survival, immunity, and disease
      resistance in aquaculture (Decamp et al., 2008; Tseng et al., 2009; Verschuere
      et al., 2000)we inoculated biofloc reactorswith a probiotic Bacillus mixture in
      an attempt to produce probiotic bioflocs. </p>
      <p>Our preliminary results showed that the water of shrimp tanks fed bioflocs
      inoculated with Bacillus had an on average 5 times lower Vibrio load when
      compared to the shrimp tanks fed an artificial feed (Crab, 2010). </p>
      <p>These results indicate that inoculating biofloc reactors with probiotic
      bacteria might have biocontrol effect toward Vibrio spp., but the inoculation of
      biofloc systems with specific desired microorganisms needs further investigation
      in order to confirm these beneficial effects. </p>
      <p>Other interesting fields of research regarding this subject are possible
      immunostimulatory features of the bioflocs. Enhancement of the innate immunity
      of cultured organisms may provide broad-spectrum resistance to infections. </p>
      <p>Existing immunostimulants include bacteria and bacterial products, complex
      carbohydrates, nutritional factors, animal extracts, cytokines, lectins, plant
      extracts and synthetic drugs such as levamisole (Wang et al., 2008). </p>
      <p>Bioflocs might also contain immunostimulatory compounds since biofloc
      technology deals with bacteria and bacterial products.</p>
