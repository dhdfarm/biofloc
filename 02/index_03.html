      <h3>The Strengths of Biofloc Technology</h3>
      <p>Biofloc technology makes it possible to minimize water exchange and water
      usage in aquaculture systems through maintaining adequate water quality within
      the culture unit, while producing low cost bioflocs rich in protein, which in
      turn can serve as a feed for aquatic organisms (Crab, 2010; Crab et al., 2007,
      2009, 2010a). </p>
      <p>Compared to conventional water treatment technologies used in aquaculture,
      biofloc technology provides a more economical alternative (decrease of water
      treatment expenses in the order of 30%), and additionally, a potential gain on
      feed expenses (the efficiency of protein utilization is twice as high in biofloc
      technology systems when compared to conventional ponds), making it a low-cost
      sustainable constituent to future aquaculture development (Avnimelech, 2009; De
      Schryver et al., 2008). </p>
      <p>Conventional technologies to manage and remove nitrogen compounds are based
      on either earthen treatment systems, or a combination of solids removal and
      nitrification reactors (Crab et al., 2007). </p>
      <p>These methods have the disadvantage of requiring frequent maintenance and in
      most instances the units can achieve only partial water purification. They
      generate secondary pollution and are often costly (Lezama-Cervantes and
      Paniagua-Michel, 2010). </p>
      <p>Biofloc technology, on the other hand, is robust, economical technique and
      easy in operation. One important aspect of the technology to consider is the
      high concentration of total suspended solids present in the pond water. </p>
      <p>Suitable aeration and mixing needs to be sustained in order to keep particles
      in suspension and intervention through either water exchange or drainage of
      sludge might be needed when suspended solids concentrations become too high
      (Avnimelech, 2009). </p>
      <p>Although it is a critical aspect of biofloc technology, detailed knowledge
      about selection and placement of aerators is still lacking. </p>
      <p>Future research should address this issue and could also investigate new
      concepts, such as the integration of biofloc technology in raceways,which might
      prevent solids build up through its proper system configuration (Avnimelech,
      2009). </p>
      <p>Construction aspects for biofloc technology pondsmerely dealwith aeration. So
      improving and fine-tuning of the design of these ponds in terms of water mixing
      and sludge control is needed (Avnimelech, 2009). </p>
      <p>Unlike the conventional techniques such as biofilters, biofloc technology
      supports nitrogen removal even when organic matter and biological oxygen demand
      of the system water is high (Avnimelech, 2009). </p>
      <p>When establishing biofloc technology in aquaculture ponds, a certain start-up
      period is needed to obtain a well-functioning system with respect to controlling
      water quality and this will depend on the nitrogen and organic load of the
      culture water and thus the intensity of the system. </p>
      <p>Likewise, in order to establish the required microbial community in a
      biofilter one needs approximately 4 weeks, depending on nutrients, water flow
      rate and temperature (Avnimelech, 2009). </p>
      <p>However, because heterotrophs grow at a rate that is 10 times higher than
      that of nitrifying bacteria in biofilters (Crab et al., 2007), bioflocs can
      usually be established much faster than conventional biofilters. </p>
      <p>To even further shorten the start-up period of biofloc technology, it might
      be interesting to investigate the effect of adding nucleation sites, such as
      clay, to thewater at start-up,whichwill stimulate floc formation. </p>
      <p>Also the inoculation withwater fromexisting good-performing biofloc ponds or
      with specific inocula might allow an accelerated startup. The strength of the
      biofloc technology lies in its ‘cradle to cradle’- concept as described by
      McDonough and Braungart (2002), in which the term waste in fact does not exist.
      </p>
      <p>Translated in biofloc terms, ‘waste’-nitrogen generated by uneaten feed and
      excreta from the cultured organisms is converted into proteinaceous feed
      available for those same organisms. </p>
      <p>Instead of ‘downcycling’, a phenomenon often found in an attempt to recycle,
      the technique actually ‘upcycles’ through closing the nutrient loop. </p>
      <p>Hence, the water exchange can be decreased without deterioration of water
      quality and, consequently, the total amount of nutrients discharged into
      adjacent water bodies may be decreased (Lezama-Cervantes and Paniagua-Michel,
      2010). </p>
      <p>In this context, biofloc technology can also be used in the specific case of
      maintaining appropriate water temperature, good water quality and high fish
      survival in low/no water exchange, greenhouse ponds to overcome periods of lower
      temperature during winter. </p>
      <p>Indeed, fish survival levels in overwintering tilapia cultured in greenhouse
      ponds with biofloc technology were excellent, being 97±6% for 100 g fish and
      80±4 for 50 g fish (Crab et al., 2009). Moreover, at harvest, the condition of
      the fish was good in all ponds, with a fish condition factor of 2.1–2.3. </p>
      <p>Besides winter periods, we need to be aware of the fact that future impacts
      of climate change on fisheries and aquaculture are still poorly understood and
      colder periods might be more often an issue to deal with in the future. </p>
      <p>The key to minimizing possible negative impacts of climate change on
      aquaculture and maximizing opportunities will be through understanding and
      promoting a wide range of inventive adaptive new technologies, such as the
      biofloc technology combined with greenhouse ponds.</p>
