      <h3>Biofloc Technology</h3>
      <p>If carbon and nitrogen are well balanced in the solution, ammonium in
      addition to organic nitrogenous waste will be converted into bacterial biomass
      (Schneider et al., 2005). </p>
      <p>By adding carbohydrates to the pond, heterotrophic bacterial growth is
      stimulated and nitrogen uptake through the production of microbial proteins
      takes place (Avnimelech, 1999). </p>
      <p>Biofloc technology is a technique of enhancing water quality through the
      addition of extra carbon to the aquaculture system, through an external carbon
      source or elevated carbon content of the feed. </p>
      <p>This promoted nitrogen uptake by bacterial growth decreases the ammonium
      concentration more rapidly than nitrification (Hargreaves, 2006). </p>
      <p>Immobilization of ammonium by heterotrophic bacteria occurs much more rapidly
      because the growth rate and microbial biomass yield per unit substrate of
      heterotrophs are a factor 10 higher than that of nitrifying bacteria
      (Hargreaves, 2006). </p>
      <p>The microbial biomass yield per unit substrate of heterotrophic bacteria is
      about 0.5 g biomass C/g substrate C used (Eding et al., 2006). </p>
      <p>Suspended growth in ponds consists of phytoplankton, bacteria, aggregates of
      living and dead particulate organic matter, and grazers of the bacteria
      (Hargreaves, 2006). </p>
      <p>Typical flocs are irregular by shape, have a broad distribution of particle
      size, are fine, easily compressible, highly porous (up to more than 99%
      porosity) and are permeable to fluids (Chu and Lee, 2004). </p>
      <p>Avnimelech (2009) recently published the handbook ‘Biofloc Technology — A
      practical guide book’ that is directed to aquaculturists, farmers, students and
      scientists and is a first tremendous step forward in providing general
      information on this technology. </p>
      <p>We refer readers to this book and to our previous paper on the basics of
      biofloc technology (De Schryver et al., 2008) for detailed information on the
      use of biofloc technology in aquaculture. </p>
      <p>The current review aims to highlight the strengths of the technology and
      identify challenges for further research</p>
