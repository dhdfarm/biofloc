      <h3>Implementation of Biofloc Technology in Aquaculture</h3>
      <p>No technique is without drawbacks and also biofloc technique is prone to
      obstacles. A major obstacle is to convince farmers to implement the technique,
      since the concept of biofloc technology goes in against common wisdom that water
      in the pond has to be clear (Avnimelech, 2009). </p>
      <p>On the other hand, several factors promote the implementation of the
      technique. </p>
      <p>Firstly, water has become scarce or expensive to an extent of limiting
      aquaculture development. </p>
      <p>Secondly, the release of polluted effluents into the environment is
      prohibited in most countries. </p>
      <p>Thirdly, severe outbreaks of infectious diseases led to more stringent
      biosecurity measures, such as reducing water exchange rates (Avnimelech, 2009).
      </p>
      <p>Experience regarding biofloc technology and technical knowledge about the
      technique needs to be transferred to the farmers in a clear, practical and
      straightforward way, not forgetting to emphasize the economic benefits of this
      technique. </p>
      <p>A very important aspect in the implementation of biofloc technology in
      aquaculture is monitoring of the ponds. Biofloc technology is not yet fully
      predictable and can therefore be risky to implement at farm level. </p>
      <p>Possible monitoring tools are the concentration of total suspended solids or
      bioflocs, and the settleability of the biofloc, which can both be measured
      quickly and easily (De Schryver et al., 2008). </p>
      <p>Molecular monitoring can also provide information on the condition of the
      bioflocs, but time and cost limitations might prevent the utility of this
      approach in real biofloc systems. </p>
      <p>As soon as future research has fine-tuned the art of biofloc technology and
      farmers can be convinced to implement the technique, consumers still will need
      to be convinced to buy aquaculture products originating from biofloc ponds. </p>
      <p>The simplified idea of recycling excreta of aquatic organisms into feed might
      frighten the consumers and prohibit them from buying these products. Despite
      this hitch, it is clear that with the growing human population, technological
      progress in aquaculture is needed to protect wild fish stocks and control fish
      prices (Jiang, 2010). </p>
      <p>Population growth pushes up fish prices as a result of a seafood shortage and
      increases pressure on wild fish stocks (Péron et al., 2010). In contrast,
      technological improvement tends to decrease fish prices and increases wild fish
      stocks by making the alternative fish product, farmed fish, relatively easier to
      produce. </p>
      <p>Therefore, biofloc technology could alleviate the depletion of wild fish
      stocks and poverty, while improving social welfare through lowering the fish
      production prices, all beneficial for both farmer and consumer. </p>
      <p>Moreover, consumers now call for guarantees that their food has been
      produced, dealt with and commercialized in a way that is not hazardous to their
      health, respects the environment and addresses diverse other ethical and social
      considerations (FAO, 2009). </p>
      <p>In addition to biofloc technology on its own, several researchers are looking
      at combinations of this technology with other innovative techniques to control
      water quality in aquaculture and its effluents. </p>
      <p>Researchers are now investigating the combination of periphyton with carbon
      to nitrogen ratio control (Asaduzzaman et al., 2008, 2010). </p>
      <p>Lezama-Cervantes and Paniagua-Michel (2010) investigated microbial mats that
      are able to adapt to large fluctuations in dissolved oxygen and pH and were able
      to remove and stabilize different organic and inorganic substrates partly due to
      the mixed autotrophic and heterotrophic communities that co-exist in the
      substrate matrix. </p>
      <p>Kumar and Lin (2010) investigated the use of short-cut nitrification–
      denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) for nitrogen removal.
      Their research indicated that these techniques could be useful and
      cost-effective especially for recirculating aquaculture systems with lower
      energy demand. </p>
      <p>The use of biofloc technology ponds integrated in a polyculture set-up is
      also an inventive and promising approach. Kuhn et al. (2009) included dried and
      processed bioflocs from tilapia ponds into shrimp feed and obtained about 1.6
      times higher average weight gain per week than that obtained with commercial
      diets. </p>
      <p>Although this is an indirect form of polyculture, the more direct form –
      where the culture of fish or shrimp is integrated with vegetables, microalgae,
      shellfish and/or seaweed – can be very promising (Neori et al., 2004). This
      integrated intensive aquaculture strategy finds its origin in traditional
      extensive polycultures. </p>
      <p>Most of today's world aquaculture production is reared in semi-intensive and
      extensive systems. Nowadays, the interest in high technology intensive
      aquaculture systems increases with the increasing demand for aquaculture
      products. </p>
      <p>Biofloc technology could be combined with polyculture ponds, further
      enhancing the water quality, natural food availability, dietary preference,
      growth and production in an intensive set-up (Rahman et al., 2008). </p>
      <p>At the University of the Virgin Islands, researchers are currently looking at
      tilapia and shrimp polyculture in intensive, bacterial-based, aerated tanks. </p>
      <p>The multitrophic approach of combining species with different specific
      feeding niches brings about a more complete use of resources than in the
      monoculture approach (Rahman et al., 2008).</p>
