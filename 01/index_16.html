      <h3>Greenhouse Raceway for Shrimp (Clemson system)</h3>
      <p>A variation of a shrimp biofloc system in a greenhouse has been evaluated at
      Clemson University. The system consists of three shrimp rearing tanks, each of
      which is 250 m2, containing 150 m3 of water. </p>
      <p>The system is operated with a
      solids concentration of 200 to 500 mg/L (15 to 50 mL/L). Water from rearing
      tanks flows to a primary solids settling tank where it is allowed to become
      anoxic. Denitrification and some alkalinity recovery occur here under those
      conditions. </p>
      <p>Water then passes to an aerated tank stocked with tilapia, which
      provide filtration (polishing) and nutrient recovery. </p>
      <p>Next, water flows into an
      intensively mixed tank with dense biofloc (1,000 to 2,000 mg/L) that serves as a
      biofilter to oxidize ammonia. Water then flows to a tank for solids settling
      before returning to the rearing tank. </p>
      <p>Settled solids are recycled to the
      suspended-growth biofilter. The main difference between this and the previously
      described system is the use of a dense suspension of biofloc separate from the
      shrimp as a biofilter. </p>
      <p>The Clemson system is also different in that it includes
      an anaerobic component in the treatment loop. The system has produced 2.5 to 3.5
      kg/m2 in a 150- to 180-day growing season. </p>
      <p>Sustainable feeding rates in excess
      of 1,000 kg/ha and peak feeding rates of nearly 1,800 kg/ha have been achieved.</p>
