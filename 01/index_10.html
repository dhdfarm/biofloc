      <h3>System Management During Start-Up</h3>
      <p>During start-up, changes in water quality in biofloc systems are remarkably
      similar to those in conventional recirculating systems. System start-up is
      characterized by time lags in peak concentrations of ammonia and then nitrite as
      the different populations of bacteria develop. </p>
      <p>If the feeding rate is increased too rapidly, concentrations of ammonia or
      (especially) nitrite can increase to the point where they become toxic and
      affect fish growth, feed conversion, disease resistance, or—in some
      cases—survival. </p>
      <p>The duration of start-up depends on a wide range of factors, including
      temperature, feeding rate scheduling, and pre-seeding of the system with the
      right kind and quantity of microbes. </p>
      <p>Acclimation protocols for biofloc systems have not been standardized, and
      many system operators have developed their own techniques through hard-won
      experience. Nitrifying bacteria can be grown in stand-alone tanks at high
      concentration and then added to rearing tanks before stocking. </p>
      <p>Adding sludge or water from a previously acclimated system is also an
      effective approach to “seeding” a new tank or pond, although the practice
      represents a biosecurity risk. Ammonia or nitrite peaks during start-up can be
      avoided or minimized by adding carbohydrate. </p>
      <p>To neutralize 1 mg/L of ammonia (as N), add 15 to 20 mg/L of sugar.
      Carbohydrate added during start-up to keep ammonia concentration low can extend
      the time required for system acclimation. </p>
      <p>Once the system is acclimated, further supplementation with carbon is
      optional because nitrifying bacteria are able to keep ammonia and nitrite
      concentrations at safe levels. </p>
      <p>Carbohydrate also can be added occasionally, as needed during the culture
      period, when ammonia concentration spikes.</p>
