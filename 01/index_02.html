      <h3>Composition and Nutritional Value of Bioflocs</h3>
      <p>Bioflocs are aggregates (flocs) of algae, bacteria, protozoans, and other
      kinds of particulate organic matter such as feces and uneaten feed. Each floc is
      held together in a loose matrix of mucus that is secreted by bacteria, bound by
      filamentous microorganisms, or held by electrostatic attraction. </p>
      <p>The biofloc community also includes animals that are grazers of flocs, such
      as some zooplankton and nematodes. Large bioflocs can be seen with the naked
      eye, but most are microscopic. Flocs in a typical greenwater biofloc system are
      rather large, around 50 to 200 microns, and will settle easily in calm water.</p>
      <p>The nutritional quality of biofloc to cultured animals is good but rather
      variable. The dry-weight protein content of biofloc ranges from 25 to 50
      percent, with most estimates between 30 and 45 percent. </p>
      <p>Fat content ranges from 0.5 to 15 percent, with most estimates between 1 and
      5 percent. There are conflicting reports about the adequacy of bioflocs to
      provide the often limiting amino acids methionine and lysine. </p>
      <p>Bioflocs are good sources of vitamins and minerals, especially phosphorus.
      Bioflocs may also have probiotic effects. Dried bioflocs have been proposed as
      an ingredient to replace fishmeal or soybean meal in aquafeeds. </p>
      <p>The nutritional quality of dried bioflocs is good, and trials with shrimp fed
      diets containing up to 30 percent dried bioflocs show promise. </p>
      <p>Nonetheless, it is unlikely that dried bioflocs could replace animal or plant
      protein sources used in commercial-scale aquafeed manufacturing because only
      limited quantities are available. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, the costeffectiveness of producing and drying biofloc solids at
      a commercial scale is questionable.</p>
