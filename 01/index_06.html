      <h3>Mixing and Aeration</h3>
      <p>Intensive turbulent mixing is an essential requirement of biofloc systems.
      Solids must be suspended in the water column at all times or the system will not
      function. </p>
      <p>Without mixing, bioflocs settle out of suspension and may form piles that
      rapidly consume nearby dissolved oxygen. These anaerobic zones can lead to the
      release of hydrogen sulfide, methane, and ammonia that are highly toxic to
      shrimp and fish. </p>
      <p>Solids can be removed by periodic flushing or by pumping sludge from the pond
      center. Sludge banks are resuspended periodically by moving and repositioning
      paddlewheel aerators. </p>
      <p>Creating turbulent conditions in relatively small tanks or raceways is much
      easier than in larger outdoor ponds. Excessive turbulence can present a
      challenge to cultured animals by making it difficult for fish or shrimp to
      locate feed. </p>
      <p>Compared to water in aquaculture ponds or most recirculating systems, water
      in biofloc systems has an elevated respiration rate caused by a high
      concentration of suspended solids. In intensive, greenwater raceways for shrimp,
      water respiration rates range from 2 to 2.5 mg O2/L per hour, although it can be
      as high as 6 mg O2/L per hour. </p>
      <p>This does not include respiration by the fish or shrimp crop, which brings
      overall respiration to 5 to 8 mg O2/L per hour. Water respiration in indoor
      brownwater biofloc systems is normally about 6 mg O2/L per hour. </p>
      <p>It is absolutely essential to provide sufficient aeration or oxygenation to
      meet this high oxygen demand and to maintain oxygen concentration at safe
      levels. These high respiration rates also indicate that the response time in the
      event of a system failure is very short, often less than 1 hour. </p>
      <p>Thus, monitoring, alarms, and emergency power systems are required elements
      of biofloc systems. In practice, aeration is used to supply oxygen and provide
      mixing. Although paddlewheel aerators supply oxygen efficiently, they are not
      ideal for pond mixing. </p>
      <p>Devices that provide only mixing are rarely used. Various configurations of
      aeration equipment are possible, depending on the specific form of biofloc
      system. </p>
      <p>In lined ponds or tanks, multiple paddlewheel aerators are arrayed to provide
      whole-pond, circular mixing. Shrimp raceways in greenhouses often use banks of
      airlift pumps placed at intervals around raceways to aerate and circulate water.
      </p>
      <p>Diffused aeration can be used in small tanks. Devices that circulate water at
      low head, such as low-speed paddlewheels and airlift pumps, can be used. </p>
      <p>The power requirement for mixing and aeration far exceeds that for
      conventional ponds and most recirculating systems. Biofloc shrimp ponds are
      aerated with 25 to 35 hp/ha, and some intensive tilapia systems are aerated with
      100 to 150 hp/ha. </p>
      <p>These intensive aeration rates could not be applied to earthen ponds without
      significant erosion; thus, most biofloc systems are lined. Biofloc systems are
      not a good choice in areas where power supplies are unreliable or electricity is
      expensive.</p>
