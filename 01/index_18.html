      <h3>Problems</h3>
      <p>Suspended solids are central to the function of biofloc systems. The capacity
      to control solids concentration depends on system configuration. Excessive
      solids concentration is counter-productive because solids can clog gills of fish
      or shrimp. </p>
      <p>It also increases the energy required for mixing to keep solids in suspension
      and aeration to meet the oxygen demand of elevated water respiration. Excessive
      solids concentration also means that the response time in the event of system
      failure is very short, often less than 1 hour. </p>
      <p>Occasionally and unpredictably bioflocs will develop that include large
      numbers of filamentous bacteria. This so-called “filamentous bulking” effect
      makes flocs slow to settle and makes it difficult to control solids
      concentration. </p>
      <p>Filamentous bacteria can also clog shrimp gills and cause mortality. The
      microbial ecology of bioflocs is understood at only the most basic level. In
      particular, the role of biofloc in controlling or encouraging pathogenic
      bacteria, especially Vibrios, requires further investigation. </p>
      <p>Vibrios will accumulate in shrimp biofloc systems and can switch on and off
      their capacity to cause disease. This switching occurs in biofloc systems
      managed at low or high solids concentrations. </p>
      <p>As in most recirculating aquaculture systems, nutrients and minerals
      (especially metals) accumulate in the water of intensively managed biofloc
      systems. In shrimp raceways with low water exchange rates, nitrate can
      accumulate to several hundred mg/L, a level that reduces shrimp feed
      consumption. </p>
      <p>Including the capacity for denitrification in intensively managed biofloc
      systems is recommended. In marine systems, maintaining a nitrate concentration
      of about 50 mg/L is an effective way to minimize the production of highly toxic
      hydrogen sulfide. </p>
      <p>Although research with the forerunners to biofloc systems has been underway
      since the early 1990s and commercial applications have been in place since the
      early 2000s, key issues of biofloc system function are still poorly understood.
      </p>
      <p>This may be related to the fact that only tilapia and shrimp have been widely
      cultured in biofloc systems and that an array of production system
      configurations have been implemented and evaluated. </p>
      <p>This diversity makes it difficult to establish general principals and design
      criteria for standard biofloc system configurations. This publication discusses
      the most important variables that must be managed properly to achieve good
      results.</p>
