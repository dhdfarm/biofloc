      <h3>Liming for Alkalinity Management</h3>
      <p>Alkalinity is the capacity of water to buffer or resist changes in pH in
      response to additions of acid or base. Water in biofloc systems should be
      maintained with ample reserves of alkalinity because it is constantly depleted
      by reactions with acid added to water. </p>
      <p>The activity of nitrifying bacteria is responsible for most losses of
      alkalinity in intensive biofloc systems. Over time, acid produced by
      nitrification wears down the reserve of alkalinity in the water. </p>
      <p>Once alkalinity is depleted, pH can drop steeply, inhibiting bacterial
      function, including that of the important nitrifying bacteria. In that case,
      ammonia accumulates to the point where fish appetite and feeding response are
      curtailed. This limits daily feeding rate, feed conversion efficiency, and,
      ultimately, yield. </p>
      <p>Alkalinity should be kept between 100 and 150 mg/L as CaCO3 by regular
      additions of sodium bicarbonate. Other liming agents are less suitable. </p>
      <p>Caustic agents (e.g., calcium hydroxide) can be used with a continuous dosing
      system. In intensive, nitrification-dominated biofloc systems, every kilogram of
      feed added to the system should be supplemented with 0.25 kilogram of sodium
      bicarbonate. </p>
      <p>Even with regular additions, facility operators should have a regular (at
      least weekly) monitoring program to evaluate alkalinity.</p>
