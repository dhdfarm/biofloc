      <h3>Basic Types of Biofloc Systems</h3>
      <p>Few types of biofloc systems have been used in commercial aquaculture or
      evaluated in research. The two basic types are those that are exposed to natural
      light and those that are not. </p>
      <p>Biofloc systems exposed to natural light include outdoor, lined ponds or
      tanks for the culture of shrimp or tilapia and lined raceways for shrimp culture
      in greenhouses. </p>
      <p>A complex mixture of algal and bacterial processes control water quality in
      such “greenwater” biofloc systems. </p>
      <p>Most biofloc systems in commercial use are greenwater. However, some biofloc
      systems (raceways and tanks) have been installed in closed buildings with no
      exposure to natural light. </p>
      <p>These systems are operated as “brown- water” biofloc systems, where only
      bacterial processes control water quality. </p>
      <p>The specifications and performance of various biofloc production systems are
      discussed in more detail at the end of this publication.</p>
