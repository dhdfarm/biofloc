      <h3>Greenhouse Raceways for Shrimp</h3>
      <p>Building upon the intensification of lined, outdoor shrimp ponds, member
      institutions of the former U.S. Marine Shrimp Farming Consortium developed
      biofloc technology in intensive lined raceways in standard greenhouses (100 feet
      long Ã— 25 feet wide). </p>
      <p>These greenhouses can be sited inland to avoid expensive coastal land and in
      areas with a temperate climate if supplemental heat is provided. Experimental or
      nursery-scale raceways (40 to 50 m3) and commercial-scale systems (250 to 300
      m3) are constructed to fit in a standard greenhouse. </p>
      <p>Raceways are shallow (about 50 to 100 cm) and typically include a central
      baffle or partition to improve internal circulation. Water movement is provided
      by banks of air-lift pumps that draw water from the tank bottom and release it
      at the tank surface or by pumps that inject water through nozzles designed to
      provide aeration. </p>
      <p>Water is directed to flow along the tank in one direction and in the opposite
      direction on the other side of the partition. Raceways also have an extensive
      network of diffused aeration to maintain biofloc in suspension. </p>
      <p>At the highest intensities and standing crops, oxygen may be injected for a
      short time after feeding or continuously as needed. Biofloc solids concentration
      is managed with settling tanks. Settling tank volume is less than 5 percent of
      system volume. </p>
      <p>Some systems include foam fractionation to capture fine solids and foam. Best
      operation occurs when settleable solids are 10 to 15 mL/L; best shrimp feed
      consumption occurs at the low end of that range. </p>
      <p>Shrimp (SPF) juveniles are stocked at 300 to 500 PL per m2 (up to 750 to
      1,000 PL per m2). Yields of 3 to 7 kg/m2 are typical, with yields of 10 kg/m2
      possible with pure oxygen supplementation. </p>
      <p>Water use is about 200 to 400 L/kg. In addition to shrimp grow-out, biofloc
      technology can be used in commercial nursery systems. </p>
      <p>The relatively small and shallow raceway is physically suitable for intensive
      nursery culture. Importantly, juvenile shrimp may be able to take better
      advantage of the nutritional benefits of biofloc than larger shrimp.</p>
