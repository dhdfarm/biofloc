      <h3>Lined Ponds for Commercial Shrimp Culture</h3>
      <p>Much of the interest in developing biofloc systems emerged from research at
      the Waddell Mariculture Center as applied to a commercial shrimp farm, Belize
      Aquaculture Limited, in the mid-1990s. </p>
      <p>Since then, the technique has been applied to ponds on large shrimp farms in
      Indonesia, Malaysia, and Australia. As mentioned previously, one major driving
      force for using biofloc technology in shrimp farming is concern about
      biosecurity, especially the control of white-spot and other viruses. </p>
      <p>The basic approach is to use relatively small (0.5- to 1.5-ha) ponds that are
      lined with plastic (usually 30- to 40-mil HDPE) and aerated intensively (28 to
      32 hp/ha) with paddlewheel aerators to maintain floc in suspension. </p>
      <p>As a rule-of-thumb, one horsepower of paddlewheel aeration can support about
      400 to 500 kg of shrimp. Aerator positioning is important and must be done to
      effect good circulation and avoid calm areas (quiescent zones) where sludge can
      accumulate. </p>
      <p>Aerators must be repositioned regularly to suspend settled solids and prevent
      toxic anaerobic zones. Biofloc concentration of 15 mL/L (as settleable solids)
      is maintained by adding grain pellets (18 percent protein) and molasses,
      resulting in an input C:N ratio greater than 15:1. </p>
      <p>When shrimp biomass reaches 10 metric tons/ ha, sludge should be drained from
      the center of ponds, if possible. Shrimp are stocked at high density (125 to 150
      PL10 per m2). </p>
      <p>The maximum daily feeding rate before harvest is 400 to 600 kg/ha. After 90
      to 120 days, yields of 20 to 25 metric tons/ha per crop of 18- to 20-g shrimp
      can be expected, although 15 to 20 metric tons/ha is probably more typical. </p>
      <p>Almost 50 metric tons/ha have been produced in intensive shrimp biofloc ponds
      stocked at 280 per m2. In comparison, conventional semi-intensive shrimp ponds
      can produce 4 to 8 metric tons/ha.</p>
