      <h3>Solids Management</h3>
      <p>In biofloc systems, waste solids are allowed to accumulate and additional
      solids are encouraged by intensive aeration and carbohydrate additions. Over
      time, and with sufficient mixing, solids can accumulate to undesirably high
      levels (2,000 to 3,000 mg/L). </p>
      <p>Biofloc systems are typically operated at suspended solids concentrations
      less than 1,000 mg/L and most often less than 500 mg/L. A suspended solids
      concentration of 200 to 500 mg/L is sufficient for good system functionality and
      will control ammonia without excessive water respiration. </p>
      <p>The best feed consumption in shrimp raceway biofloc systems occurs at a
      solids concentration of 100 to 300 mg/L. Imhoff or settling cones are a simple
      way to index suspended solids concentration. </p>
      <p>The cones have marked graduations on the outside that can be used to measure
      the volume of solids that settle from 1 liter of system water. The interval of
      time should be standardized and convenient, usually 10 to 20 minutes. </p>
      <p>Solids also can be measured with a turbidity meter. Maintaining a settleable
      solids concentration of 25 to 50 mL/L will provide good functionality in biofloc
      systems for tilapia. In lined biofloc shrimp ponds, 10 to 15 mL/L is the typical
      target range. </p>
      <p>Turbidity of 75 to 150 NTU is comparable to the recommended settleable solids
      concentration provided that color interference is not too severe. </p>
      <p>Solids concentration should be managed as a compromise between the
      functionality of the biofloc system as a biofilter (for ammonia control) and the
      oxygen demand of the water, which increases directly with solids concentration.
      </p>
      <p>In other words, the concentration should be as low as possible to provide
      sufficient biofiltration and not so high that the requirement for aeration and
      mixing power is excessive. </p>
      <p>Operating rearing tanks with relatively low suspended solids concentration
      reduces the risk of dissolved oxygen depletion associated with system failure by
      increasing response time. </p>
      <p>A relatively low suspended solids concentration also allows photosynthesis by
      algae to contribute to the oxygen supply.</p>
