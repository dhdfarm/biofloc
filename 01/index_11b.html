      <h3>Using Settling Tanks for Solids Control</h3>
      <p>Simple gravity settling tanks, also known as clarifiers, can be used to
      control solids concentration at high feeding rates in superintensive biofloc
      systems. Clarifiers can be operated intermittently whenever the assessment of
      solids concentration with Imhoff cones indicates that the target range has been
      exceeded. </p>
      <p>Alternatively, clarifiers can be operated continuously if sized so that a
      relatively small proportion of the tank volume is clarified each day. Good
      control of solids concentration can be achieved by operating clarifiers at a
      flow rate that turns over the rearing tank water every 3 to 4 days. </p>
      <p>In general, clarifier volume is 1 to 5 percent of system volume and is
      operated at a flow rate to provide a residence time of 20 to 30 minutes, which
      is sufficient to settle most heavy solids. </p>
      <p>Clarifiers are simple to use and effective at removing coarse, easily settled
      solids. However, the aggressive use of clarifiers to control suspended solids
      may leave fine solids or larger solids that do not settle readily in the system.
      </p>
      <p>Fine solids can be removed with foam fractionators or dissolved air flotation
      units. In practice, the size distribution of solids in biofloc systems is not
      managed. </p>
      <p>Management of biofloc solids is limited to controlling their retention time,
      although most biofloc systems have limited capacity to control solids
      concentration.</p>
