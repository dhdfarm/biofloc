      <h3>Nitrification</h3>
      <p>The two-step oxidation of ammonia to nitrate is called nitrification. The
      bacterial process transforms a toxic form of nitrogen (ammonia) to one that is
      toxic only at high concentrations (nitrate). </p>
      <p>Over time, nitrate accumulates in low-exchange biofloc systems. In contrast
      to rapid cycling between dissolved ammonia and algal or bacterial cells,
      nitrification is responsible for the long-term, ultimate fate of a large
      fraction (25 to 50 percent) of the nitrogen from feed added to intensive biofloc
      systems. </p>
      <p>This mechanism becomes relatively more important as production intensity, as
      measured by daily feeding rate, increases. To simplify the nitrogen dynamics in
      biofloc systems with low water exchange: Waste nitrogen is repeatedly cycled
      between dissolved ammonia and solids of algae or bacteria. </p>
      <p>If solids are removed, a significant fraction of added nitrogen can be taken
      out of the system. If solids are not removed, a large proportion of nitrogen (as
      ammonia) is ultimately oxidized to nitrate, which accumulates.</p>
