      <h3>Suitable Culture Species</h3>
      <p>A basic factor in designing a biofloc system is the species to be cultured.
      Biofloc systems work best with species that are able to derive some nutritional
      benefit from the direct consumption of floc. </p>
      <p>Biofloc systems are also most suitable for species that can tolerate high
      solids concentration in water and are generally tolerant of poor water quality.
      Species such as shrimp and tilapia have physiological adaptations that allow
      them to consume biofloc and digest microbial protein, thereby taking advantage
      of biofloc as a food resource. </p>
      <p>Nearly all biofloc systems are used to grow shrimp, tilapia, or carps.
      Channel catfish and hybrid striped bass are examples of fish that are not good
      candidates for biofloc systems because they do not tolerate water with very high
      solids concentrations and do not have adaptations to filter solids from water.</p>
