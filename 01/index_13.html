      <h3>Denitrification and Sludge Treatment</h3>
      <p>Alkalinity can be recovered in denitrification units. Nitrate accumulates in
      most intensive biofloc systems because of ongoing nitrification. If unchecked,
      nitrate concentration reflects the cumulative feed loading to the system. </p>
      <p>Nitrate accumulation can be tempered by dilution through water exchange, but
      this defeats the purpose of intensive water use and reduces biosecurity. </p>
      <p>Denitrification units are used as part of a water conservation and
      biosecurity strategy where it is also a cost issue to conserve salts. This is an
      acute need in superintensive saltwater systems for shrimp, especially those
      located inland. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, the discharge of saline effluent is restricted or regulated in
      many areas, especially inland. Denitrification units are operated under
      generally quiescent and anoxic conditions. </p>
      <p>Solids can be shunted to a side-stream tank and allowed to accumulate. A low
      flow of culture water, sufficient to provide a detention time of 1 to 2 days, is
      adequate to control nitrate concentration. Solids accumulation will reach a
      steady state. </p>
      <p>Under anoxic conditions, the steady supply of nitrate is used as an oxidant
      to continually oxidize organic matter, although simple organic carbon (sugar)
      may be needed to bolster the process. </p>
      <p>Bicarbonate is released by bacteria as a by-product of this process. Thus,
      the alkalinity that was lost from nitrification can be recovered by
      denitrification. Additional water can be conserved by using a sequencing batch
      reactor to reduce the volume of sludge and mass of solids discharged from an
      intensive aquaculture facility. </p>
      <p>The specific sequence of operational steps is: </p>
      <ul>
      	<li><b>Fill.</b> A batch of sludge collected from settling tanks is added to
      	the reactor. (Closed reactors work best but are not necessary; any tank or
      	vessel is suitable.) </li>
      	<li><b>React.</b> Solids and residual bioflocs are vigorously mixed and
      	aerated for Â½ to 1 day to promote solids degradation. </li>
      	<li><b>Settle. </b>Mixing and aeration are stopped. Most solids will settle
      	quickly and nearly all within 2 to 3 hours. </li>
      	<li><b>Decant.</b> The clean water that overlies the settled solids is drawn
      	off and returned to the biofloc system. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This sequence is repeated for each additional batch of sludge. Water with a
      rotten-egg odor, indicating hydrogen sulfide, should not be returned to culture
      tanks before it is vigorously aerated. </p>
      <p>One variation of the process is to extend the settling period. Very quickly
      after settling, respiration by settled biofloc solids will fully consume all
      oxygen in the water. </p>
      <p>Anoxic conditions allow other reactions to occur, including denitrification.
      Operation is then alternated between an aerated, suspended, oxidized mode and a
      quiescent, settled, anaerobic mode. This alternation takes advantage of multiple
      bacterial pathways to break down organic matter.</p>
