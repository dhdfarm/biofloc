      <h3>Bacterial Assimilation</h3>
      <p>Many of the early names for biofloc systems included the word
      “heterotrophic,” which describes a group of bacteria that, by definition,
      obtains carbon from organic sources. </p>
      <p>Despite large inputs of feed to intensive systems, the growth of
      heterotrophic bacteria in biofloc systems is limited by dissolved organic
      carbon. </p>
      <p>To stimulate production of heterotrophic bacteria, the C:N ratio of inputs is
      raised by adding a supplemental source of carbohydrate or reducing feed protein
      level. </p>
      <p>By this manipulation, heterotrophic bacteria create a demand for nitrogen (as
      ammonia) because organic carbon and inorganic nitrogen are generally taken up in
      a fixed ratio that reflects the composition and requirement of bacterial cells.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, ammonia can be controlled by adding organic carbon to stimulate the
      growth of heterotrophic bacteria. Similar to algae, ammonia is “immobilized”
      while packaged in heterotrophic bacterial cells as protein. </p>
      <p>Because the growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria is so much greater than
      that of nitrifying bacteria, ammonia control through immobilization by
      heterotrophic bacteria occurs rapidly, usually within hours or days if a
      sufficient quantity of simple organic carbon (e.g., sugar or starch) is added.
      </p>
      <p>The packaging of nitrogen in bacterial cells is temporary because cells turn
      over rapidly and release nitrogen as ammonia when they decompose. Cells are also
      consumed by fish or removed as excess solids. </p>
      <p>As with nitrogen assimilated by algae, microbial protein in flocs containing
      heterotrophic bacteria can serve as a supplemental source of nutrition for fish
      and shrimp.</p>
