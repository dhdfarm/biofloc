      <h3>Effect of Feeding Rate and The Greenwater-to-Biofloc Transition</h3>
      <p>A predictable sequence of changes occurs over time in sunlight-exposed
      biofloc systems as feeding rate is increased. At some point, a system will
      abruptly transition from a greenwater, algal system to a brownwater, bacterial
      system. </p>
      <p>The transition described here is based on conditions in an intensive
      greenhouse raceway for shrimp. Conditions leading to the transition from
      greenwater to brownwater biofloc will vary somewhat in different system types
      (i.e., ponds, raceways, tanks). </p>
      <p>As daily feeding rate increases from 100 to 200 kg/ ha (10 to 20 g/m2), the
      water will appear green with a dense algae bloom. Algal uptake is the main
      mechanism for ammonia control. The aerator power required at this feeding rate
      is about 25 to 30 hp/ha. </p>
      <p>At a daily feeding rate of 300 kg/ha, there is an abrupt shift when the lack
      of light at very high algal density hinders photosynthesis. </p>
      <p>Bacteria begin to grow and bioflocs develop, as indicated by an increase in
      suspended solids concentration (250 to 500 mg/L) and the associated rapid
      increase in water respiration (6 mg O2/L per hour). This requires a five-fold
      increase in aerator power from 30 to 150 hp/ha to match the oxygen demand. </p>
      <p>Most of this increased energy demand is required to maintain bioflocs in
      suspension. Despite these changes, the water continues to appear green and there
      is a slight surplus of oxygen produced. </p>
      <p>When the feeding rate is between 400 and 600 kg/ ha per day, the water
      appears green-brown. Beyond 700 kg/ha per day, the water appears brown with
      biofloc and there is essentially no contribution by algae. Further increases in
      feeding rate require correspondingly more aerator power.</p>
      <p>The transition is sometimes difficult to perceive visually. The functional
      shift from a surplus to a deficit of oxygen occurs while the water continues to
      look green. </p>
      <p>The color change from green to brown takes place after the transition from a
      mostly algal to a mostly bacterial biofloc system has occurred. </p>
      <p>So water color is not an accurate indicator of system status. At high
      aeration rates, the appearance of large amounts of surface foam is a good sign
      of a system in transition.</p>
