      <h3>Lined Tanks for Tilapia</h3>
      <p>The biofloc system at the University of the Virgin Islands consists of a main
      tank for tilapia rearing and smaller tanks for sedimentation (clarifier), base
      addition, and denitrification. </p>
      <p>The rearing tank is 16 m in diameter and is managed with a water depth of 1 m
      (volume = 200 m3). The tank is constructed of reinforced, concrete lintel block
      walls and a 30-mil plastic (HDPE) liner over a smooth earthen tank bottom that
      slopes slightly (3 percent) to a center drain. </p>
      <p>Three ¾-hp vertical pump aerators are placed in the tank, with one aerator
      operated during the first 2 months and then one additional aerator operated
      during each subsequent 2-month period. </p>
      <p>Another ¾-hp vertical pump aerator is oriented horizontally and operated
      continuously for mixing. This aerator establishes a rotational water flow that
      concentrates solids toward the center drain. </p>
      <p>A line from a center drain extends to a 1.9-m3 clarifier (1 percent of system
      volume). Water is pumped to the clarifier continuously with a ¼-hp centrifugal
      pump that provides a flow rate of about 10 gallons per minute. </p>
      <p>The clarifier is operated with a retention time of 50 minutes, sufficient to
      settle 90 percent of solids, including all coarse solids and algal floc. Most
      solids settle readily in 10 minutes. The full volume of the rearing tank passes
      through the clarifier every 3 to 4 days. </p>
      <p>The clarifier can keep suspended solids concentration in the rearing tank at
      about 500 mg/L. Sludge discharged from the bottom cone of the clarifier is
      directed to a denitrification reactor (50 feet × 4 feet × 3 feet). </p>
      <p>The denitrification reactor is operated with a flow rate sufficient to give a
      residence time of 1 day. Nitrification rates of 3 mg/L per day have been
      obtained. Nitrate concentration increased with cumulative feed loading, with an
      accumulation rate of about 25 g/kg feed. </p>
      <p>Before the denitrification reactor was added, nitrate accumulated to 600 to
      700 mg/L (as N) after 6 to 7 months of operation. A nitrogen budget for this
      system indicated that 45 percent of the nitrogen added in feed was recovered as
      nitrate, 24 percent was in harvested tilapia, and 31 percent was in sludge. </p>
      <p>Liming (1 to 2 kg/d of quicklime [Ca(OH)2]) is needed to replace the
      alkalinity lost from acid added by nitrification and to maintain pH at about
      7.5. Sustainable daily feeding rates of 175 to 200 g/m3 (1,750 to 2,000 kg/ha)
      have been achieved. </p>
      <p>The maximum standing crop of tilapia is about 15 kg/m3 when fish are stocked
      at 20 to 25/m3. The working range of conditions for this system include
      management of solids concentration to 300 to 500 mg/L, equivalent to a
      settleable solids concentration of 25 to 50 mL/L. </p>
      <p>The direct energy requirement per unit of fish production is about 3.5 to 4 k
      Wh/kg. Water use efficiency is very high, about 100 L/kg. Replacement water
      equivalent to 0.2 to 0.4 percent of tank volume was needed to replace daily
      losses.</p>
