      <h3>Ammonia Dynamics</h3>
      <p>A major goal of water quality management in any aquatic animal production
      system is maintaining ammonia concentration below toxic levels. In biofloc
      systems, there are three main processes that control ammonia— algal uptake,
      bacterial assimilation, and nitrification. </p>
      <p>The transformations and dynamics of ammonia in biofloc systems are complex,
      involving interplay among the algae and bacteria that compete for ammonia. </p>
      <p>The relative importance of each process depends on many factors, among them
      the daily feeding rate, suspended solids (biofloc) concentration, ammonia
      concentration, light intensity, and input carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N) ratio.</p>
      <h4>Algal Uptake</h4>
      <p>In any biofloc system exposed to sunlight, a dense algal bloom will develop
      in response to nutrient loading from feeding. Nutrients released from
      decomposing organic matter (including dead algae, fecal solids, and uneaten
      feed) are rapidly taken up and stored in algae cells. </p>
      <p>The rate of algal uptake in biofloc systems is mainly influenced by
      underwater light intensity. In biofloc systems with a primary dependence on
      algal uptake, extended periods of cloudy weather can cause spikes of ammonia
      concentration. </p>
      <p>The accumulation of biofloc solids shades out algae and limits ammonia
      uptake. Daily fluctuation in dissolved oxygen concentration and pH, despite
      intensive aeration, is another characteristic of biofloc systems where algal
      activity is predominant. </p>
      <p>Generally, at daily feeding rates less than 300 kg/ha (30 g/m2), algal
      activity is the major factor controlling water quality.</p>
      <h4>Bacterial Assimilation</h4>
      <p>Many of the early names for biofloc systems included the word
      “heterotrophic,” which describes a group of bacteria that, by definition,
      obtains carbon from organic sources. </p>
      <p>Despite large inputs of feed to intensive systems, the growth of
      heterotrophic bacteria in biofloc systems is limited by dissolved organic
      carbon. </p>
      <p>To stimulate production of heterotrophic bacteria, the C:N ratio of inputs is
      raised by adding a supplemental source of carbohydrate or reducing feed protein
      level. </p>
      <p>By this manipulation, heterotrophic bacteria create a demand for nitrogen (as
      ammonia) because organic carbon and inorganic nitrogen are generally taken up in
      a fixed ratio that reflects the composition and requirement of bacterial cells.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, ammonia can be controlled by adding organic carbon to stimulate the
      growth of heterotrophic bacteria. Similar to algae, ammonia is “immobilized”
      while packaged in heterotrophic bacterial cells as protein. </p>
      <p>Because the growth rate of heterotrophic bacteria is so much greater than
      that of nitrifying bacteria, ammonia control through immobilization by
      heterotrophic bacteria occurs rapidly, usually within hours or days if a
      sufficient quantity of simple organic carbon (e.g., sugar or starch) is added.
      </p>
      <p>The packaging of nitrogen in bacterial cells is temporary because cells turn
      over rapidly and release nitrogen as ammonia when they decompose. Cells are also
      consumed by fish or removed as excess solids. </p>
      <p>As with nitrogen assimilated by algae, microbial protein in flocs containing
      heterotrophic bacteria can serve as a supplemental source of nutrition for fish
      and shrimp.</p>
      <h4>Nitrification</h4>
      <p>The two-step oxidation of ammonia to nitrate is called nitrification. The
      bacterial process transforms a toxic form of nitrogen (ammonia) to one that is
      toxic only at high concentrations (nitrate). </p>
      <p>Over time, nitrate accumulates in low-exchange biofloc systems. In contrast
      to rapid cycling between dissolved ammonia and algal or bacterial cells,
      nitrification is responsible for the long-term, ultimate fate of a large
      fraction (25 to 50 percent) of the nitrogen from feed added to intensive biofloc
      systems. </p>
      <p>This mechanism becomes relatively more important as production intensity, as
      measured by daily feeding rate, increases. To simplify the nitrogen dynamics in
      biofloc systems with low water exchange: Waste nitrogen is repeatedly cycled
      between dissolved ammonia and solids of algae or bacteria. </p>
      <p>If solids are removed, a significant fraction of added nitrogen can be taken
      out of the system. If solids are not removed, a large proportion of nitrogen (as
      ammonia) is ultimately oxidized to nitrate, which accumulates.</p>
