      <h3>Balancing Input C:N Ratio</h3>
      <p>In biofloc systems, a major factor that controls ammonia concentration is the
      C:N ratio of feed and other inputs. A feed with a 30 to 35 percent protein
      concentration has a relatively low C:N ratio, about 9 to 10:1. </p>
      <p>Increasing the C:N ratio of inputs to 12 to 15:1 favors the heterotrophic
      pathway for ammonia control. The low C:N ratio of feed can be augmented by
      adding supplemental materials with high C:N ratio. Or, the input C:N ratio can
      be increased by reducing feed protein content. </p>
      <p>Ammonia uptake by heterotrophic bacteria occurs rapidly after carbohydrate
      supplementation. Ammonia control through the heterotrophic pathway is often more
      stable and reliable than algal uptake or nitrification. </p>
      <p>Many practical and processed materials have been used as carbon sources in
      biofloc systems, including grain pellets, molasses, sugar cane bagasse, and
      chopped hay, among others. </p>
      <p>Carbohydrate materials should be low-cost and convenient. Organic matter that
      breaks down easily and quickly is best. Heterotrophic bacteria in biofloc
      systems can act on simple organic matter rapidly, within minutes to hours. </p>
      <p>Simple carbohydrates such as sugar (sucrose or dextrose) or starch will have
      the quickest effect. The best carbon source to add during system start-up, when
      the most rapid response is needed, is simple sugar. </p>
      <p>To promote exclusive control of ammonia concentration by the heterotrophic
      pathway, carbohydrate additions must be made in accordance with feeding rate.
      For every 1 kg of 30 to 38 percent protein feed added, add 0.5 to 1 kg of a
      carbohydrate source such as sugar. </p>
      <p>More carbohydrate is needed at the higher protein level. It is clear that
      relatively large quantities of carbohydrate must be added to control ammonia
      concentration this way. Less carbohydrate can be added if other ammonia removal
      pathways are operating simultaneously in a biofloc system. </p>
      <p>There are several drawbacks to continually adding organic carbon to control
      ammonia. This pathway encourages the production of bacterial solids, which
      accumulate. </p>
      <p>If not controlled, solids concentration may reach levels that cause gill
      clogging. More oxygen will be needed to support the respiratory demands of a
      greater bacterial load, and additional energy is needed to keep solids in
      suspension. </p>
      <p>High rates of water respiration (oxygen consumption) reduce response time in
      the event of system failure. Capacity must be added to remove, treat, and
      dispose of accumulated solids. </p>
      <p>Ongoing carbon supplementation is required to control ammonia with this
      approach. In order to stop carbon supplementation, a system must be “weaned.”
      </p>
      <p>Stopping the supplemental carbon abruptly before the nitrification pathway is
      sufficiently developed will lead to water quality instability and potentially
      detrimental spikes of ammonia and/or nitrite. </p>
      <p>Once carbon supplementation ceases, superintensive biofloc systems naturally
      tend toward the nitrification pathway of ammonia control.</p>
