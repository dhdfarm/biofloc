      <h3>What Biofloc Systems Do</h3>
      <p>Bioflocs provide two critical servicesâ€”treating wastes from feeding and
      providing nutrition from floc consumption. Biofloc systems can operate with low
      water exchange rates (0.5 to 1 percent per day). </p>
      <p>This long water residence time allows the development of a dense and active
      biofloc community to enhance the treatment of waste organic matter and
      nutrients. In biofloc systems, using water exchange to manage water quality is
      minimized and internal waste treatment processes are emphasized and encouraged.
      </p>
      <p>The advantages and disadvantages of biofloc systems compared to ponds and
      recirculating systems are summarized in Table 1. Research with shrimp indicates
      that culture water contains growth-enhancing factors, such as microbial and
      animal proteins, that boost production. </p>
      <p>Flocs are a supplemental food resource that can be grazed by shrimp or
      tilapia between feedings of pelleted diets. A potential benefit of biofloc
      systems is the capacity to recycle waste nutrients through microbial protein
      into fish or shrimp. </p>
      <p>About 20 to 30 percent of the nitrogen in added feed is assimilated by fish,
      implying that 70 to 80 percent of nitrogen added as feed is released to the
      culture environment as waste. In biofloc systems, some of this nitrogen is
      incorporated into bacterial cells that are a main component of biofloc. </p>
      <p>Consumption of this microbial protein, in effect for a second time,
      contributes to growth. Research with shrimp and tilapia suggests that for every
      unit of growth derived from feed, an additional 0.25 to 0.50 units of growth are
      derived from microbial protein in biofloc systems. </p>
      <p>In other words, 20 to 30 percent of shrimp or tilapia growth is derived from
      the consumption and digestion of microbial protein. This benefit is reflected in
      improved feed conversion, one of the best predictors of system profitability and
      business sustainability. </p>
      <p>However, the value of flocs in nutrition is limited at the highest levels of
      production intensity because the contribution of feed to growth of cultured
      animals is overwhelming.</p>
