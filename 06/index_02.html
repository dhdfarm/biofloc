      <h3>Biofloc</h3>
      <p>Biofloc is a conglomeric of heterogenous bacteria, algae, fungi, protozoans,
      metazoans, rotifers, copepods, nematodes, colloids, organic polymers,
      particulate organic matter such as uneaten feed, feaces and detritus. </p>
      <p>The floccules are loosely held together in a matrix of mucus secreted by
      bacteria and electrostatic attraction. Bioflocs vary in size 1-200µm and can
      reach more than 1000µm. </p>
      <p>They are irregular in shape, easily compressible, highly porous and permeable
      to fluids. Color generally ranges from brown to green, depending upon the
      constituents. Bioflocs have slow sinking rate, kept floating by aeration
      increasing the opportunity to derive nutrients from water column. </p>
      <p>Normally flocs comprise 2-20% living microbial cells, 60-70% organic matter,
      and 30-40% total inorganic matter. A typical biofloc contains 4 components:
      bacterial colony, filamentous bacteria, absorbed matter and algae. Biofloc
      volume is measured with Imhoff cones. </p>
      <p>Desirable floc volume ranges between 1-40 ml/L in fish culture and 2-15 ml/L
      in shrimp culture. Besides the volume, color and various physico-chemical
      parameters and nutritive value like protein levels, fatty acids etc., have also
      been used to characterize the flocs. </p>
      <p>The biofloc is an assemblage of more than 750 operational taxonomic units
      [OTUs] and recently as many as 2000 OTUs were identified</p>
