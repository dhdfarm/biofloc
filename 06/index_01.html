      <h3>Biofloc Technology for Sustainable Aquaculture</h3>
      <p>Aquaculture is an efficient protein production sector offers ample
      opportunities to alleviate poverty, hunger and malnutrition, generates economic
      growth and ensures better use of natural resources.It has rising at an average
      annual rate of 6.6% since 1995. </p>
      <p>Globally, India occupies the second position after China, with sharing 10.0%
      of worldâ€™s aquaculture production which is about 0.9% of the country GDP during
      2015-16. The vast resources in terms of water bodies and species of fish and
      shellfish in different agro-ecological regions of the country provide for a wide
      array of culture systems and practices. </p>
      <p>However, various obstacles hampered the successful production. The
      aquaculture industry has sought new innovative ways to reduce the impact on the
      environment, and maximize efficiency. </p>
      <p>Much of the focus on alternative approach towards sustainable and
      environment-friendly technology for enhancing large-scale production. Biofloc
      technology has gained attention recently as an environment-friendly and
      sustainable aquaculture. </p>
      <p>Hence, the present attempt has been made to summarize the features of the
      environmental friendly biofloc farming system.</p>
