      <h3>Bioinformatic Analyses of Microbial Community Composition and Diversity</h3>
      <p>Rarefaction curves were plotted for each sample to characterize sampling
      depth (Amato et al., 2013). Alpha-diversity analyses were calculated using the
      Mothur (Schloss et al., 2011), including community richness parameters (Chao)
      and community diversity parameters (Shannon). </p>
      <p>Beta diversity measurements were calculated as described by Jiang et al.
      (2013). Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) plots based on Jaccard
      distance were utilized to visualize the separation of microbiota structure
      across different groups. </p>
      <p>Statistical testing among variation in microbial community composition was
      carried out using the analysis of similarity (ANOSIM). P &lt; .05 was considered
      statistically significant. </p>
      <p>The relationships among microorganisms' populations and water quality
      parameters (temperature, pH, DO, ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, and phosphate) was
      examined by distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA). </p>
      <p>Environmental factors were selected by VIF (Variance inflation factor), and
      the environmental factors with VIF &gt; 10 were removed from the db-RDA analysis.
      </p>
      <p>The analyses of NMDS, ANOSIM and db-RDA were performed with the R package
      “vegan: Community ecology” package (Oksanen et al., 2007). </p>
      <p>Statistical differences in water quality parameters (temperature, pH, DO,
      ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, and phosphate) among treatments were tested using a
      one-way ANOVA and Duncan's multiple-range test in SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics
      19.0, IBM, USA) after verifying the homogeneity of variance using Levene's test.</p>
