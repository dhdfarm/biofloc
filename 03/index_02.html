      <h3>Experimental Facilities</h3>
      <p>To investigate the effect of BFT on water quality and fish production, we
      studied three treatments: CT, BT and BZT. Nine enclosures (three treatments in
      triplicate) were placed in an outdoor aquaculture pond to simulate a real
      aquaculture environment. </p>
      <p>The square enclosures had five faces (bottom and surround, 2m3) made by
      tarpaulin sheets that prevented water exchange. Nine nylon net cages (2m3) were
      placed into the enclosures to rear the fish over a period of 8 weeks. </p>
      <p>The upper edge of the enclosures and net cages were suspended 30 cm above the
      surface using a metal frame and plastic floats to keep the shape of the
      enclosures. The deep of pond were 1.7 m. </p>
      <p>The water in the enclosures originated from the pond. The pond was located at
      the farm of National Protospecies Farm of Four Major Chinese Carp (29°49&#8242;48.8&#8243;N,
      112°29&#8242;01.3&#8243;E) in Shishou, China, and had a surface area of 1960m2, which was
      standard and common in China.</p>
