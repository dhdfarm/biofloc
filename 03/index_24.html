      <h3>Effects of Biofloc Treatment on Dissolved Nitrogen and Phosphorus</h3>
      <p>Both in the pond of aquaculture and the enclosure of present study, feed was
      added continually and increasingly. When glucose and air were added
      continuously, high carbohydrate and DO in the culture water enabled the
      assimilatory activity of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria to convert ammonium into
      bacterial biomass. </p>
      <p>The concentration of dissolved nitrogen and phosphorous (TAN, NO3-N, TN and
      TP) were reduced in BFT treatments, demonstrating the capacity of BFT to
      mitigate the build-up of excess nitrogen and improve water quality. These
      findings are consistent with the previous studies (Xu and Pan, 2013; Zhao et
      al., 2014). </p>
      <p>When carbohydrate added to the water (C/N=20), the change of dissolved
      nitrogen was mainly due to the increase in organic nitrogen. </p>
      <p>The improvements occurred in water that was not exchanged, showing that
      biofloc treatment is compatible with fish health and relatively intense
      stimulation of microbial activity with constant additions of glucose and dietary
      supplements. </p>
      <p>Based on the budgets of nitrogen, the inputs may be recycled via the biofloc.
      Nitrogen may eliminate from pond water by the process of denitrification and
      sedimentation. Based on the nitrogen budget, more nitrogen was removed from the
      system in the CT than BFT treatments. </p>
      <p>Supplementary air and carbohydrate provided an idea environment for aerobic
      heterotrophic bacteria. In the past, researchers thought that of the rate of
      heterotrophic nitrification was low (Robertson and Kuenen, 1988). </p>
      <p>While the effect of heterotrophic nitrification in the nature environment was
      noticed gradually. </p>
      <p>Several strains isolated from wastewater treatment plants were capable of
      simultaneous heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification, including
      members of Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, Thiosphaera, Rhodococcus and Pseudomonas
      can convert oxidized or nitrified ammonium to denitrified products such as NO,
      N2O and N2 under aerobic conditions (Chen et al., 2007; Honda et al., 1998;
      Robertson and Kuenen, 1990; Su et al., 2001). </p>
      <p>In our study, the abundances of Acinetobacter spp., Rhodococcus sp., Bacillus
      sp., Pseudomonas spp. were lower in water of BFT than CT treatments. Thus, the
      nitrogen eliminated to air of BFT should be lower than that of CT due to the
      absence of the heterotrophic nitrifiers community in BFT. </p>
      <p>DO concentration is an important factor that affects competition between PAB
      (polyphosphate accumulator) and GAB (glycogen accumulator), where PABs are
      favored at low DO levels. </p>
      <p>Biological phosphorus removal processes systems operated at low DO levels to
      minimize the proliferation of GAOs (Carvalheira et al., 2014). In the present
      study, the DO was kept high to keep the fish healthy and this did, in fact, lead
      to higher growth of GABs and the near absence of PABs. </p>
      <p>The absence of PABs may have impacted on the recycling of phosphorus in the
      water. The effect of low levels of PAB on phosphorus cycling in biofloc systems
      should be studied in the future. Nitrification, the conversion of ammonia to
      nitrate via nitrite, is an important way to remove ammonia. </p>
      <p>It is a two-step process catalyzed by ammonia-oxidizing and nitrite-oxidizing
      bacteria (AOB and NOB). Aerobic ammonia-oxidation is often the first,
      rate-limiting step of nitrification. </p>
      <p>A few previous studies (Rowan et al., 2003, Tawan et al., 2005, You et al.,
      2003) have debated whether Nitrosospira or Nitrosomonas is the predominant
      species in various wastewater treatment systems, while opposite results have
      been published (Siripong and Rittmann, 2007 and Thomas et al., 2010). </p>
      <p>We found that Nitrosospira spp. and Nitrobacter spp. was abundant in water of
      aquaculture pond, Nitrospira spp. occupied the position of Nitrosomonas spp. in
      the treatment BFT.</p>
