      <h3>Bioinformatic Analysis</h3>
      <p>Raw fastq files were demultiplexed, quality-filtered by Trimmomatic and
      merged by FLASH with the following criteria: (i) reads were truncated at any
      site receiving an average quality score &lt; 20 over a 50 bp sliding window; (ii)
      primers were allowed two nucleotide mismatches; (iii) reads containing ambiguous
      bases were removed; and (iv) sequences with &#8805;10 bp overlap longer were merged.
      </p>
      <p>Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were clustered with 97% similarity cut-off
      using UPARSE (v.7.1 http://drive5.com/uparse/) and chimeric sequences were
      identified and removed using UCHIME. </p>
      <p>Taxonomy was assigned by RDP Classifier algorithm (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/)
      against the Silva 16S rRNA database (SSU123) using a confidence threshold of
      70%. </p>
      <p>The average read length was approximately 400 bp after quality trimming. A
      phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor joining method with CLUSTAL X
      and MEGA 6.0.</p>
