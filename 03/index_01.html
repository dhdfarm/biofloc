      <h3>Biofloc Formation, Water Quality and Fish Yield</h3>
      <p>Global aquaculture production of fish reached 80.0 million tons of salable
      food (USD 231.6 billion), and provided 10.8 kg of fish per capita consumption in
      2016 (FAO, 2018). Fresh water pond plays a major role in aquaculture production,
      which was the source of 47.5 million tons of finfish (FAO, 2018). </p>
      <p>Chinese pond aquaculture produced 22.9 million tons of freshwater aquaculture
      production and occupied 2.8 million ha of water surface in 2016 (72% of total
      freshwater aquaculture production, and 43.9% of total freshwater aquaculture
      area) (Fisheries Administration, 2017). </p>
      <p>The average annual growth rate of world aquaculture production during
      2001–2016 was 5.8% (FAO, 2018). The expansion of aquaculture is restricted by
      land and water requirements. Pond aquaculture relies on high stocking density,
      protein-rich feed and aeration. </p>
      <p>The development of the polyculture systems, where the different fish species
      occupy different niches lead to major increases in productivity (Wang et al.,
      2015). </p>
      <p>The combined culturing of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus), common carp
      (Cyprinus carpio) and crucian carp (Carassius spp.) resulted in the production
      of 5.9, 3.5 and 3 million tons of each fish, respectively, in China in 2016
      (Fisheries Administration, 2017). </p>
      <p>Higher productivity also depends on higher inputs of fish feed, resulting in
      increased waste production which has environmental and economic costs. Of the
      total nitrogen input to culture ponds, only 20–30% is retained in fish biomass
      and the rest becomes a polluting agent of the water by producing high level
      toxicants such as ammonia and nitrite (Islam, 2005). </p>
      <p>As a result, it is necessary to frequently exchange pond water, leading to
      eutrophication and the degradation of surrounding watersheds. The accumulation
      of excess nitrogen also necessitates drying the pond to oxidize the organic
      matter accumulated as sediment or remove the sediment of the pond every year.
      </p>
      <p>A more environmentally sustainable form of aquaculture, ‘Biofloc Technology’
      (BFT), was first developed in the early 1970s by Aquacop (1975) at Ifremer-COP.
      The system was later improved by supplying carbohydrates to the system by
      Avnimelech in 1999. </p>
      <p>BFT is based on encouraging the growth of microorganisms in the aquaculture
      by adding carbohydrates (sucrose, glucose, cassava or cellulose) to the water to
      control the carbon-to&#8209;nitrogen ratio (C/N ratio), optimized for minimum water
      exchange (Crab et al., 2012). </p>
      <p>High C/N ratios shift the dominant community of microorganisms from
      autotrophic to heterotrophic in the culturing system (Browdy et al., 2001). This
      promotes rapid growth of bacteria and nitrogen uptake into microbial biomass.
      </p>
      <p>Flocs form from bacterial biomass, becoming more visible to fish and shrimp.
      Management of a BFT system minimizes the release of water from the aquaculture
      system, thereby reducing environmental impacts in the form of excess nutrients
      and pathogens (Emerenciano et al., 2013). </p>
      <p>Today, BFT is used throughout the world with many aquaculture species. The
      underlying mechanisms of BFT remains unclear. The exploration of the bacterial
      community of aquaculture ponds and the intestines of cultured organisms is
      necessary to understand the mechanisms. </p>
      <p>Cardona et al. (2016) reported that the bacterial communities in the
      intestines of shrimp were characteristic of the bacteria in floc, suggesting
      that supporting certain bacteria with favored substrate or nitrogen sources may
      facilitate flocculation. </p>
      <p>In one study, the predominant flocculating bacteria was Bacillus sp. in the
      bioflocs treatment (Zhao et al., 2012). Ray et al. (2010) used gas
      chromatographic measurement of bacteria-specific fatty acids to predict the
      changes in bacterial abundance. </p>
      <p>In the activated sludge (AS) process, which has been widely studied and
      applied for municipal sewage and industrial wastewater treatment, bacterial floc
      formation plays a central role in it. </p>
      <p>A zoogloea-forming organism was isolated by An et al. (2016) from activated
      sludge in the Wuhan, China and identified as Zoogloea resiniphila MMB. </p>
      <p>The addition of selected strains of microorganisms with known capabilities,
      or bioaugmentation, is commonly used to improve the performance of biological
      wastewater treatment plants (Abeysinghe et al., 2002). </p>
      <p>Z. resiniphila MMB should have a potential ability to promoted floc formation
      and be used in the bioaugmentation of activated sludge. </p>
      <p>The bacterial floc formation should be important in BFT aquaculture system.
      To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet examined the effect of
      bioaugmentation on biofloc formation in aquaculture. </p>
      <p>In freshwater environments, water quality and fish biomass are regularly
      affected by earth off-flavor. The odorous compounds have been identified as
      geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB), which are semi-volatile terpenoids
      produced by cyanobacteria, actinomycetes, fungi, and myxobacteria (Zuo et al.,
      2010). </p>
      <p>The effects of BFT on organisms which produce these compounds, and the
      off-flavor of fish, are not presently known. We investigated the effects of BFT
      and bioaugmented BFT on the water quality, nitrogen budget and generation of
      off-flavor in a polyculture of Chinese carp. </p>
      <p>We traced nitrogen utilization and characterized the microbial communities in
      pond water and the intestines of carp in different culturing systems, namely
      conventional treatment (CT), biofloc-stimulated treatment (BT), and biofloc
      bioaugmented with Zoogloea resiniphila MMB treatment (BZT).</p>
