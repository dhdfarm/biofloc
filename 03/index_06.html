      <h3>Water Quality Determination and Water Sample Collection</h3>
      <p>Throughout the trial period, total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), pH, DO, water
      transparency (WT) were tested once every three days, other water quality
      parameters, nitrite nitrogen (NO2-N), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), total nitrogen
      (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and biofloc volume (BFV), were tested fortnightly.
      </p>
      <p>At every sampling time point, 3 water samples were taken in each enclosure
      from 3 different places. </p>
      <p>The 3 water samples were mixed and tested twice. The determination of TAN,
      NO2-N, NO3-N, TN, TP and TOC followed the methods described by the Water and
      Wastewater Monitoring Analysis (State Environmental Protection Administration of
      China, 2002). </p>
      <p>BFV (suspended solids in CT) determination used Imhoff cones by registering
      the volume of sediment from 1000 mL of water sample after 20 min precipitation
      (Avnimelech, 1999). Water temperature and DO were monitored by using
      multiparameter water quality instruments (PRO ODO, YSI, USA). </p>
      <p>At the end of the experiment, water was taken from each enclosure at 3
      different places and completely mix to determine geosmin and 2- MIB
      concentrations and bacterial community. </p>
      <p>Duplicate one-liter water samples with biofloc (suspended solid in CT) were
      collected and immediately transferred a clean sterile 1 L glass bottle leaving
      no headspace to avoid volatilization. </p>
      <p>Samples were immediately preserved in an icebox packed with ice packs during
      transit to the laboratory. Each sample was filtered through four to five 1.2 &#956;m
      pore size, 47mm diameter GF/C filters (Whatman, Norway). </p>
      <p>Each set of filters was cut into fragments in mm-sized pieces with a
      disposable sterile scalpel blade. Microbial DNA was extracted from samples using
      the E.Z.N.A.Â® soil DNA Kit (Omega Bio-tek, Norcross, GA, U.S.) according to
      manufacturer's protocols. </p>
      <p>The DNA extract from each set of filters were pooled to prepare one DNA pool
      per enclosures.</p>
