      <h3>Determination of Chemical Composition and Odorants</h3>
      <p>Proximate composition analysis of diet and fish was performed according to
      the standard methods described by AOAC (2003). Water samples for off-flavor
      analysis were centrifuged in 100-mL glass centrifuge tubes at 4 °C and 4000 rpm
      for 20 min to remove undissolved substance and biofloc. </p>
      <p>The concentrations of geosmin and 2-MIB in water samples were determined by
      headspace solid-phase microextraction- gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
      (HSPME-GC–MS) and performed according to the methods described by Zuo et al.
      (2010). </p>
      <p>The concentrations of odorants in fish filet were determined by microwave
      mediated distillation with HSPME-GC–MS determination (Zhu et al., 1999). The
      concentrations of geosmin and 2-MIB in the water and filet were analysed in
      duplicate for each sample.</p>
