      <h3>The Formation and Structure of Biofloc</h3>
      <p>Bioaugmentation with the activate sludge flocculating bacteria, Zoogloea
      resiniphila MMB, had no discernable impact on biofloc formation in our
      aquaculture system. </p>
      <p>There were no differences between the two biofloc treatments. Z. resiniphila
      MMB was not detected by 16 s RNA sequencing. </p>
      <p>The failure of the bioaugmentation should because that glucose was not the
      ideal carbon source and the competition in the original pond water was excessive
      for Z. resiniphila MMB. </p>
      <p>The two closest relatives to Zoogloea had low sequence similarity and were
      also low in abundance in the water. In contrast, Actinobacteria were dominant in
      the BFT treatments, and other filamentous bacterium were also significantly
      increased in the water environment of BFT. </p>
      <p>These results indicated that filamentous bacterium formed the major structure
      of biofloc, which was different to bacterial communities in activated sludge.
      Floc-forming bacterial strains from activated sludge are commonly members of
      Zoogloea (Wang et al., 2012 and Zhang et al., 2012). </p>
      <p>Filamentous bacteria do grow in activated sludge and can be advantageous;
      however, when they grow in excess amounts, extending from the floc into the bulk
      fluid, the settling process is impaired and foaming can occur upon aeration. </p>
      <p>These problems did not occur in the aquaculture system, likely because large
      particles of flocculation are more likely to be consumed by fish. </p>
      <p>Further characterization of the composition of floc in BFT is necessary and
      could use electronic microscopy or fluorescence in situ hybridization to observe
      the structure and membership of the</p>
