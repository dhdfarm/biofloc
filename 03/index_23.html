      <h3>Bacterial Diversity and Composition</h3>
      <p>High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes provided fine-scale resolution
      of the bacterial community in pond water. Bacterial diversity was promoted by
      BFT in all samples, especially in the intestines of gibel carp and common carp.
      </p>
      <p>The composition of aquatic microorganisms is known to affect the microflora
      of fish (Gatesoupe, 1999) and, as could be seen in NMDS plots. The intestinal
      microflora in fish is likely both determined by living environment and fish
      species. </p>
      <p>The living environment of Gibel carp and common carp were the same, while the
      intestinal microflora was different. Proteobacteria were the most abundant
      bacterial phylum in the untreated CT groups. </p>
      <p>This phylum is common to the aquatic environment and plays an important role
      in the process of nutrient cycling and the mineralization of organic compounds
      (Kirchman, 2002; Kersters et al., 2006). </p>
      <p>In BFT, Proteobacteria were also relatively abundant, though members of other
      phyla, namely Actinobacteria, Fusobateria, Chloroflexi and Saccharibacteria,
      increased. </p>
      <p>The most abundant bacterial phyla identified in our experimental pond
      differed from those in a marine shrimp tank (Cardona et al., 2016), and
      resembled with those in fresh water tank (Wei et al., 2016). </p>
      <p>In both BFT treatments, several water quality parameters was improved over
      time, such as total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen, whereas these parameters
      increased in CT. </p>
      <p>We could conclude that the supplement of glucose, and continuous aeration,
      had a significant effect on the structure of the pond microflora and that these
      changes affected water quality. </p>
      <p>The water quality is significantly correlated with the composition of the
      environmental micro flora (Fig. 10). The bacterial community, nutritional
      composition, and structure of bioflocs was affected by the type of carbohydrate
      (Crab et al., 2010; Wei et al., 2016). </p>
      <p>Wei et al. (2016) used a biofloc system, which was without animal, included
      tap water mixed with pond water, added glucose as carbon sources, found bioflocs
      were dominant in Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. </p>
      <p>Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria predominated in the BFT treatments in the
      present study. This could be due to the original bacterial from the pond water
      and animal.</p>
