      <h3>Taxonomy-Based Bacterial Community Composition</h3>
      <p>Bacterial communities significantly differed by sample source and treatment. Proteobacteria predominated in the water environment of CT (61.6%) and
      included, in order of dominance, the &#945;-class (35.4%), &#946;-class (16.2) and &#947;-class
      (8.8%). </p>
      <p>Acidobacteria (14.7%), Verrucomicrobia (6.3%) and Bacteroidetes (4.8%) were
      also abundant members of the water in the CT enclosure. </p>
      <p>In contrast, the bacterial communities in BT and BZT showed increased
      relative abundances of Actinobacteria, Fusobateria, Chloroflexi and
      Saccharibacteria, with the relative abundance of Proteobacteria decreasing to
      33.4% and 30%. </p>
      <p>The proportion of Cyanobacteria also decreased from 2.8% in CT to 1.2% and 1%
      in BT and BTZ, respectively. Intestinal communities differed from those in water
      and were affected by BFT. </p>
      <p>There was a significant difference in the intestinal communities between fish
      species in CT, where the Gibel carp was dominated by Fusobateria (64.8%)
      followed by Proteobacteria (30.0%) and the common carp was dominated by
      Proteobacteria (44.3%) then Fusobateria (28.0%). </p>
      <p>Significant differences in intestinal communities were also observed between
      CT and biofloc treatment in the increase in Actinobacteria. The 50 genera with
      the greatest differences in relative abundance among treatments were selected
      for multiple comparisons and presented as a heatmap. </p>
      <p>At the genus level, the bacterial communities in the water and intestines of
      two carp hosts varied in abundance among treatments. These results supported the
      results of NMDS analyses and community bar plot analysis. </p>
      <p>In the first level of cluster tree, the gut microbiota of Gibel carp and
      common carp in CT clustered by treatment; however, in BT and BZT, water, Gibel
      carp and common carp clustered according to origin and host at shorter
      distances. </p>
      <p>Gibel carp and common carp from biofloc treated enclosure were clustered in
      the second level, then clustered with water from biofloc treated enclosure in
      the third level. The bacterial community of water from CT clustered with water
      and gut samples from BT and B&amp;ZT.</p>
