      <h3>Changes in Biofloc and Water Quality</h3>
      <p>Biofloc was quantified in terms of biofloc volume (BFV). The addition of
      glucose significantly increased the BFV during the experiment with the highest
      values in both BFT enclosures. </p>
      <p>The BFV in BT and BZT were similar during the feed trial. DO was saturated
      throughout the experiment (Fig. 1B). pH in BT and BZT significantly decreased
      relative to CT. The water transparency in CT was also significantly
      higher than BT and BZT. </p>
      <p>All forms of dissolved nitrogen were significantly lower in BT and BZT
      compared to CT. Total ammonia nitrogen was highly fluctuating and
      was highest in CT, which reached 1.61 mg L&#8722;1. </p>
      <p>The NO2-N values of all the treatments reached the highest value on the 42nd
      day. Total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were in accordance
      with TAN, NO2-N and NO3-N, which was high in CT and low in BT and BZT. </p>
      <p>The nitrogen budget was calculated, and during the experiment about 12 g
      nitrogen per cubic meter was added to the enclosures in the form of fish feed.
      </p>
      <p>The accumulation rate of nitrogen in fish body was 28% in the CT group and
      42% (nitrogen of fish accumulation/ nitrogen of feed input) in the BT and BZT
      groups (Graphical abstract). </p>
      <p>The main form of nitrogen loss was counted by total input nitrogen minus
      nitrogen of fish accumulation, nitrogen of biofloc (suspended solids in CT)
      accumulation and dissolved total nitrogen. Nitrogen loss into sediment and gas
      efflux was higher in CT than in BT and BZT.</p>
