      <h3>Alpha and Beta Diversity of the Bacterial Community</h3>
      <p>The flattening rarefaction curves confirmed that sequencing depth was
      sufficient (Fig. 4). The microbial community in the water environment was more
      diverse than the community identified in the intestinal content of Gibel carp
      and common carp. </p>
      <p>The Shannon diversity and Chao richness of microbial communities in CT were
      lowest in both water and fish intestines compared to BT and BZT (Fig. 5).
      Bacterial communities in the water and intestines of the two carp species
      significantly differed according to NMDS analysis, based on Jaccard distances
      (ANOSIM, Global R=0.689 and P=.001). </p>
      <p>Triplicates tended to cluster according to both sample origin and whether
      biofloc technology was applied. Microbiota of biofloc from BT and BZT clustered
      together, gut microbiota of Gibel carp from BT and BZT clustered together and
      gut microbiota of common carp from BT and BZT clustered together. </p>
      <p>In contrast, bacterial communities in all sample types from CT were separated
      from biofloc treatments. The communities of Gibel carp and common carp from CT
      partially overlapped.</p>
