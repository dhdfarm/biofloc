      <h3>Feeding and Biofloc Treatment</h3>
      <p>The duration of the study was 60 days from July 30th to September 24th, 2017.
      Fish were fed to apparent satiation two times per day (8:00, 16:00). </p>
      <p>According to the method of Avnimelech's (1999), the amount of glucose added
      was 49.61% of the weight of daily feed supplied. </p>
      <p>The glucose was dissolved with pond water from the enclosures and returned to
      the same biofloc treatment one hour after feeding time to maintain a C/N ratio
      of 20:1. </p>
      <p>Zoogloea resiniphila MMB was provided by Professor Dongru Qiu (Institute of
      Hydrobiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan), which was isolated from the
      municipal sewage treatment plant located in Wuhan City (An et al., 2016). </p>
      <p>A 200-mL culture of Zoogloea resiniphila MMB (1Ã—108 cfu mL&#8722;1) was added to
      each enclosure of the BZT every week. During the experiment, no water was
      changed in all enclosures. Evaporation was compensated with the addition of pond
      water. </p>
      <p>A microporous aerator pipe connected to a Roots blower was used to aerate and
      agitate water throughout the experiment to ensure the dissolved oxygen (DO)
      remained between 6.50 and 9.50 mg L&#8722;1. Enclosures were exposed to natural
      lighting.</p>
