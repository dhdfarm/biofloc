      <h3>Relationships Between Environmental and Microbial Parameters</h3>
      <p>The variance inflation factor (VIF) was used to judge the collinearity among
      different environmental factors. Total phosphorus had strong collinearity (VIF=12.74)
      with other water quality factors such as total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen and
      was removed. </p>
      <p>The db-RDA demonstrated that total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen showed a
      significant relationship with the microbial communities. </p>
      <p>By including intestinal communities in the analysis, all three major forms of
      nitrogen (nitrite, nitrate, total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen) showed a
      significant relationship (pnitrate=0.005, ptotal nitrogen=0.001, pammonia
      nitrogen=0.002) with community composition. </p>
      <p>There were notable differences in abundances of OTUs among treatments in
      water that reflected differences in the functional characteristics of
      communities (Fig. 10). Filamentous bacterium dominated in BT and BZT. </p>
      <p>They belonged to the following genera: Gordonia sp. (Actinobacteria),
      Nocardia farcinica (Actinobacteria) and Ca. Microthrix sp. (Actinobacteria),
      Chloroflexi sp. (Chloroflexi); Meganema sp. (Proteobacteria), Ca. Alysiosphaera
      sp. (Proteobacteria) and Sphaerotilus sp. (Proteobacteria). </p>
      <p>Glycogen-accumulating organisms (GAB) were identified according to their
      membership in the genus Ca. Competibacter sp., which had a high population in BT
      and BZT. </p>
      <p>In contrast, polyphosphateaccumulating bacteria (PAB) (Ca. Accumulibacter
      sp.) were almost absent in all treatments. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria of
      Nitrosomonas spp. and Nitrospira spp. could be observed in treatments but were
      higher in BT and BZT. </p>
      <p>Photoheterotrophic bacteria were also highest in BT and BZT. The relative
      abundance of Cyanobacteria decreased in BT and BZT, in contrast to
      Actinobacteria (Fig. 8), suggesting glucose amendments favored heterotrophic
      over autotrophic bacteria. </p>
      <p>Actinobacteria dominated not only in the water environment, but also in the
      intestines of Gibel carp and common carp in biofloc treatments. During the
      experiment, no fish died. The potential pathogenic bacteria identified by their
      genus, only four OTUs significantly differed by treatment. </p>
      <p>An OTU classified to Aeromonas sp. had a higher proportion in the carps'
      intestines in CT compared to biofloc treatments. Two OTUs related to
      Mycobacterium fortuitum significantly increased in the carps' intestines in BT
      and BZT, while three other closely related Mycobacterium showed a similar trend.
      </p>
      <p>Pseudomonas spp. and Legionella spp. were only present in the water of CT
      enclosures.</p>
