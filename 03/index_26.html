      <h3>The Functions of Actinobacteria in Biofloc</h3>
      <p>The relative abundance of Actinobacteria increased in water and fish
      intestines in BFTs, demonstrating their importance to the formation and
      consumption of biofloc. </p>
      <p>Actinobacteria are Gram-positive, saprophytic bacteria which often grow
      extensive mycelia. Their extensive capability to produce antibiotics may serve
      to control pathogens in aquaculture (Goodfellow and Fiedler, 2010), which was
      corroborated by the strong decline in relative abundance of Aeromonas sp. in BTF
      treatments. </p>
      <p>Aeromonas sp. dominated in the intestines of fish in CT with mean proportion
      of 20%. However, Aeromonas sp. was absent from the intestines of fish in BT and
      BZT. Actinobacteria are also as sources of earth off-flavor chemicals, geosmin
      and 2-MIB, in aquaculture (Gerber and Lechevalier, 1965; Schrader and
      Summerfelt, 2010). </p>
      <p>Cyanobacteria are commonly considered the major contributors of these
      off-flavor episodes in aquaculture ponds, the relative abundance of
      Cyanobacteria was diminished in BT and BZT, while geosmin and 2-MIB
      concentrations increased because of Actinobacterial relative abundances. </p>
      <p>Thus, we propose that Actinobacteria perform four major functions in biofloc
      aquaculture systems: 1) their filamentous structure to promote the formation of
      floc; 2) their antibiotics protect against fish pathogens; 3) their biomass
      serves a nutritive function; and 4) they produce geosmin and 2-MIB leading to
      occurrence of earth off-flavor in fish.</p>
