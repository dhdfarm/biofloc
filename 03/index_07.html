      <h3>Fish Sample Collection</h3>
      <p>At the beginning of the experiment, three samples (3 fish for each sample)
      from each enclosure were collected to determine the initial body composition.
      </p>
      <p>After feeding trial, all the fish were anesthetized by MS-222 (100 mg L&#8722;1
      tricaine methane sulfonate, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and then bulk weighted.
      </p>
      <p>Three fish were randomly selected from each of the replicate enclosures to
      analyze final body composition. Dorsal muscles of another three fish from each
      enclosure were collected, placed into liquid nitrogen and stored at &#8722;80 °C until
      determination of geosmin and 2-MIB concentrations. </p>
      <p>The digesta from gibel carp and common carp were collected 12 h after the
      last feeding to determine bacterial community. Six fish were randomly selected
      from each of the 3 replicate enclosures, and the digesta were collected under
      aseptic conditions. </p>
      <p>The digesta samples from the 6 fish/enclosure were pooled as a replicate. DNA
      was extracted from each pooled sample by using E.Z.N.A.® soil DNA Kit (Omega
      Biotek, Norcross, GA, U.S.), according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
