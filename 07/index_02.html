      <h3>Material and Methods</h3>
      <p><b>Tested material:</b> Catfish (Clarias gariepinus) with size approximately
      2.3±0.12 g fish G1 was used as tested material with stocking density of 50
      fish/container. For seven days prior to treatment,catfish was cultured in
      aquarium for adaptation. Size of each container was 90×40×50 cm, filled with 100
      L well water, equipped with aerator system with minimum water exchange.</p>
      <p><b>Feed preparation, strain of bacteria and biofloc culture system:</b>
      Commercial pellet withprotein content of 31.77% was used as feed. Before being
      fed to the fish, feed was fermented usingBacillus sp., cells for two days, with
      the cells concentration of 102 CFU mLG1 (treatment A),104 CFU mLG1 (treatment B)
      and 106 CFU mLG1 (treatment C). </p>
      <p>Approximately 10 mL mG3 Bacillus sp., cells was added into culture media for
      once a week according to each treatment dosage. Molasses containing 35% C was
      added into biofloc media with final concentration C:N ratio of 15:1.</p>
      <p><b>Pisciculture:</b> Four days prior to treatment (D-4), 10 mL mG3 Bacillus
      sp., was inoculated accordingto designated bacterial concentration for each
      treatment into culture media, together with 10 gliquid molasse. </p>
      <p>Daily growth rate of bacteria in media was monitored until D-0, just before
      catfishstocking. The fish was farmed for 42 days, fed twice a day with feeding
      rate of 5% from fishbiomass. Sampling to measure fish growth was conducted once
      every 2 weeks, with once a weekfish fasting in all treated groups, beside
      non-biofloc control group.</p>
      <p><b>Experiment design:</b> Completely randomized design was applied on 5
      treatments, whichwere 102 CFU mLG1 (A), 104 CFU mLG1 (B), 106 CFU mLG1 (C),
      biofloc without Bacillus sp., cellsaddition (K+), without biofloc as well as
      Bacillus sp., cells addition (KG, control). Each data wastaken triplicate.</p>
      <p><b>Survival rate:</b> Survival Rate (SR) was calculated in D-42 using
      equation by Effendi (2004).</p>
      <p><b>Specific growth rate: </b>This parameter was calculated as the weight of
      the fish after 42 days,calculation was conducted using equation by Huisman
      (1987).</p>
      <p><b>Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR): </b>The FCR is the amount of feed consumed by
      fish (g) to increase1 g of fish weight, calculated to measure fish growth rate
      and consumed feed. Equation used wasbased on Zonneveld et al. (1991).</p>
      <p><b>Proximate analysis: </b>The analysis was conducted on fermented feed and
      formed biofloc in the finalstage of experiment, consisted of; protein content,
      lipid content, free-nitrogen extract material,moisture content and ash content
      (AOAC., 1995).</p>
      <p><b>Amount of bacterial population:</b> Total bacterial population was
      measured once every 7 daysusing total plate count method at serial dilution from
      10G1-10G8 CFU mLG1. Culture wasincubated at 28-30°C for 24-28 h. The colony
      number was calculated using following formula by Madigan et al. (2014).</p>
      <p><b>Data analysis:</b> Data from specific growth rate, survival rate, Feed
      Conversion Ratio (FCR) and biofloc proximate analysis was statistically measured
      using one-way analysis of variance(Steel and Torrie, 1980) using SPSS software
      (versi 18) at confidence interval of 95% (p&lt;0.05).</p>
      <p>Turkey test was following when significant difference present. Data of
      bacteria amount wasanalyzed in description.</p>
