      <h3>Growth Performance of Catfish in Biofloc</h3>
      <p>Catfish is one of widely cultivated fish in Indonesia, with 613,120 t
      production rate in 2014 12.75% higher from previous year. </p>
      <p>The increasing production rate of catfish from super intensive culture
      unfortunately brings the negative impact on environment quality which then might
      affectthe fish health. </p>
      <p>Organic waste from remaining feed, feces, as well as fish metabolic waste is
      among several causes for environmental degradation. </p>
      <p>Previous study suggested that biofloc aquaculture technology is a promising
      alternative to overcome the problems. Moreover, application of this technology
      is more profitable by decreasing inorganic nitrogen waste as well as providing
      additional feed for cultured fish, thus increasing fish growth and feed
      efficiency. </p>
      <p>Biofloc technology can be applied using addition of organic carbohydrate into
      the culture media to increase C/N ratio and to stimulate the growth of
      heterotrophic bacteria (Crab et al., 2007).</p>
      <p>Heterotrophic bacteria are able to rapidly assimilate Total Ammonia Nitrogen
      (TAN) in water environment, converted into protein in optimum C/N ratio for
      bacteria growth (Avnimelech, 1999),which then form the biofloc. </p>
      <p>De Schryver et al. (2008) studied that the biofloc consists of phytoplankton,
      bacteria, living aggregates, organic matter, cation and dead cells. This mixture
      of microbial communities growing well in the media containing nitrogen waste,
      recycles excreted nitrogen form the cell biomass which can be consumed by fish (Avnimelech,
      2007).</p>
      <p>According to Irianto (2003), Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium and
      Bacillus polymyxa were among those which can be used to improve water quality of
      culture ponds. </p>
      <p>Probiotic is also functioned as immuno stimulant, able to increase feed
      conversion ratio, able to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria, produce
      antibiotic and improve water quality (Kesarcodi-Watson et al.,2008). </p>
      <p>This study was aimed to evaluate growth performance of catfish (Clarias
      gariepinus) cultivated in biofloc-based super intensive culture added with
      Bacillus sp.</p>
