      <h3>Discussion</h3>
      <p>The survival rate of treatment C group was higher (p&lt;0.05) than negative
      control (KG) andpositive control (K+). Both treatment A and B were significantly
      different (p&lt;0.05) compare to negative control (50.67±3.77%) but not significant
      compare to positive control (75.33±3.77%). </p>
      <p>This result indicated that Bacillus sp., cells addition into biofloc-based
      culture media for catfish wasable to increase the survival rate. Similar result
      also indicated by another research usingStaphylococcus lentus on biofloc-based
      catfish culture, resulted higher cumulative mortality thancontrol (Salamah et
      al., 2015). </p>
      <p>Research by Decamp et al. (2008), Tseng et al. (2009) andVerschuere et al.
      (2000) also noted that Bacillus sp., addition was able to increase
      growthperformance and survival rate of fish culture.</p>
      <p>Azim and Little (2008) mentioned that, the presence of optimum concentration
      microbial cellin biofloc was able to increase fish health status. Bacterial
      cells in the biofloc accumulate thepoly-&#946;-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) with alleged
      role in microbial pathogens inhibition of fish culture.</p>
      <p>The PHB content in biofloc consumed by fish was able to increase its immune
      system so that thefish can be more resistant to environmental interference
      during treatment (Michaud et al., 2006).</p>
      <p>The non-biofloc control (KG) had low survival rate due to diverse rate of
      catfish growth, whichlater increasing fish cannibalism. The main contribution of
      fish cannibalism in non-biofloc culturewas 49.33%. </p>
      <p>Baras and D’Almeida (2001) noted that irregular diverse size of the fish
      affected therate of survival as well as cannibalism rate during larvae catfish
      culture. During 7 weeksof C. gariepinus culture, cannibalism reported as the
      main cause for mortality up to 60-93%(Adamek et al., 2011).</p>
      <p>The Specific Growth Rate (SGR) of A, B and C treated groups significantly
      higher than controlgroups. In this study, protein content of biofloc was also
      increased in line with Bacillus sp.,concentration, the highest was 34.06% in
      treatment C. </p>
      <p>It is indicated that the catfish effectivelyconsume the biomass of biofloc
      with Bacillus sp., cells addition. </p>
      <p>Several previous studies suggestedthat biofloc was able to enhance the growth
      of tilapia (Avnimelech, 1999, 2007), Macrobrachiumrosenbergii (Asaduzzaman et
      al., 2008), vanname shrimp (Xu et al., 2012; Ju et al., 2008b;Kuhn et al., 2009,
      2010; Burford et al., 2004), tiger shrimp (Anand et al., 2014) and crucian
      carp(Wang et al., 2015).</p>
      <p>The addition of Bacillus sp., cells into the feed had positive impact on fish
      digestive system dueto exogenous enzymes released by the cells, thus expenditure
      energy was more effective duringdigestion. </p>
      <p>Energy difference resulting from this process can be used for the growth. Liu
      et al. (2009) mentioned that the increasing growth rate of aquatic organisms
      provided with probiotic in theirfeed was related to higher enzymatic digestion
      activity together with vitamin synthesis, therefore, digestibility and organism
      weight were also increased.</p>
      <p>Feed conversion ratio from treatment A, B and C were all significantly
      different (p&lt;0.05) withnegative control (KG), but not significantly different to
      the positive control (K+). </p>
      <p>This result indicated that biofloc system was able to increase feed
      efficiency indicated by lower feed conversion ratio. Several previous studies
      suggested that biofloc was able to substitute conventional fish feed and reduce
      FCR value in tiger shrimp (Anand et al., 2014). </p>
      <p>It was also indicated that Bacillus sp., addition into cultivation media had
      positive contribution on feed efficiency, significantly different compared to
      control. This was cause by rich content of bioactive compound of biofloc such
      ascarotenoids, chlorophyll, phytosterol, bromophenols, amino sugar (Ju et al.,
      2008a) and anti-bacteria compounds (Crab et al., 2010). </p>
      <p>Bacillus sp., cells addition into biofloc resulted inbetter growth rate and
      FCR. Utilized feed could be reduced by 10-20% by biofloc technologyapplication
      (De Schryver et al., 2008). </p>
      <p>Verschuere et al. (2000) noted that probiotic cells contributed to higher
      immune response by increasing intestinal microflora balance through increasing
      feed quality, enzymatic role during digestion, inhibition of pathogenic
      microorganisms and growth factor.</p>
      <p>Protein content of feed is an important factor for aquatic organism
      nutrition. Nutritionalcontents in feed adequate for catfish were 24-26% protein
      (Halver and Hardy, 2002) and 3-6% lipid(Webster and Lim, 2002). </p>
      <p>In this study, average protein content of biofloc in treated groups
      was32.81±1.25% protein and 7.83±1.35% lipid. </p>
      <p>High content of protein and lipid in thebiomass of biofloc was presumably
      related to concentration of Extracellular Polymer Substances(EPS), approximately
      of 80-95% of organic matter in biofloc (Wilen et al., 2008).</p>
      <p>Previous study presented by Tacon et al. (2002) mentioned that 35-38%
      protein, 5-9% lipid,7-10% ash and 18-19 kJ gG1 energy were contained in biofloc
      produced in closed-system shrimpculture using commercial feed. </p>
      <p>This result indicated that protein, lipid, carbohydrate and ashcontent in
      biofloc can be utilized as fish culture feed (Crab et al., 2010). Biofloc can be
      consideredas complete nutrition source and contained several bioactive compounds
      and probably unidentifiedfactors as well (Ju et al., 2008b). </p>
      <p>With similar protein content with commercial feed, biofloc isbeneficial for
      fish growth.The amount of total bacteria of the treatments from the initial
      stage to the final ranged between 106 and 108 CFU mLG1, with dynamic pattern
      throughout culture period. </p>
      <p>Increasing rateof bacterial cells population occurred 3 days after Bacillus
      sp., cells inoculation. It was alsoobserved before treatment. </p>
      <p>In the first day after inoculation (D-4 prior to treatment), cellspopulation
      was ranging from 104 up to 105 CFU mLG1 and in the next day (D-3 prior to
      treatment), it was increased in the range of 106-107 CFU mLG1. </p>
      <p>And the next day (D-2 prior to treatment), itwas 105-107 CFU mLG1, whereas,
      day-4 (D-1 prior to treatment), total bacterial cells started todecrease into
      104-105 CFU mLG1.The carbohydrate is an important carbon source for the growth
      of bacterial cells. </p>
      <p>The carbohydrate addition into culture media was able to rapidly stimulate
      the growth of heterotrophic bacterial cells (Avnimelech, 1999). </p>
      <p>Therefore, molasses addition as carbon source was able topromote bacterial
      cell propagation in the culture medium. </p>
      <p>As mentioned by Burford et al. (2004), carbon source addition was able to
      support transformation of inorganic nitrogen into microbialprotein through
      increasing population of heterotrophic bacterial cells.</p>
      <p>Water quality parameters were considered in the range values of normal for
      all treated groups.Measurement results showed that water temperature, DO, pH,
      TAN, nitrite, nitrate and ammoniain all treatment groups were in optimum
      condition for catfish culture. </p>
      <p>Dissolved oxygen rangedfrom 4.0 up to 8.1 ppm, while pH ranged from 5.30 up
      to 7.95 for all treatments. Duringexperiment, the temperature ranged from
      30.2-32.6°C. Ammonia content for all treatments rangedfrom 0.001 up to 0.028 mg
      LG1 which was considered as standard quality. </p>
      <p>According to Boyd (1982),0.1 mg LG1 ammonia content was able to reduce fish
      growth and causing damage to the gills ofchannel catfish. </p>
      <p>Nitrite content ranged from 0.002 up to 1.49 mg LG1 and nitrate ranged from
      0.16up to 1.23 mg LG1 for all treatments. Nitrite level should be less than 1 mg
      LG1 for properaquaculture condition (Timmons and Ebeling, 2007).</p>
