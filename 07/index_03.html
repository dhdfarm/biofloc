      <h3>Results</h3>
      <p><b>Survival rate:</b> Survival rate of the fish during experiment was
      presented in Fig. 1. Survival rateof treatment C of 89.33±2.4% was higher
      (p&lt;0.05) than negative control (KG) and positive control(K+) groups, but not
      significant different compare to treatment A (87.33±6.59%) and B(86.67±9.42%).
      </p>
      <p>Results from both treatment A and B were significantly different (p&lt;0.05)
      tonegative control (50.67±3.77%) but not significant to positive control
      (75.33±3.77%).</p>
      <p><b>Specific growth rate: </b>Daily growth rate during 42 days
      experimentshowed that treated groups were significantly different to control
      groups (p&lt;0.05). </p>
      <p>Highest SGR was obtained by treatment C (6.35±0.05%), which not significantly
      different (p&gt;0.05) to treatmentA (6.04±0.09%) and B (6.16±0.11%). However,
      results from those 3 treatments were all significantly different to K+ (positive
      control) and KG (negative control) of 5.21±0.22 and 5.08±0.26%,respectively.</p>
      <p><b>Feed Conversion Ratio (FCR): </b>Feed conversion ratio of catfish grown in
      biofloc culture was indicated that results from treated groups were
      significantly different(p&lt;0.05) to KG (negative control). Highest FCR was
      obtained by treatment C (0.91±0.01), followed by B (0.98±0.11), A (0.99±0.06),
      then K+ (1.01±0.07), whereas, FCR for negative control (KG) was1.42±0.26.</p>
      <p><b>Proximate composition of biofloc and fermented feed:</b> Proximate
      composition of biofloc during experiment showed that protein content, nitrogen
      free extract, ash and crude fiber of biofloc from all probiotic treatments were
      not significantly different(p&lt;0.05) to K+. </p>
      <p>Protein content of biofloc from treatment C was 34.06±1.70, A and B were
      31.99±2.70and 31.81±1.51, respectively, while K+ was 31.64±4.31. In the other
      hand, lipid content of biofloc from all probiotic treatments were significantly
      different (p&lt;0.05) to K+. </p>
      <p>Highest lipid contentobtained from K+ (14.92±2.87), followed by C
      (9.17±4.53), A (7.87±1.69) and B (6.47±0.86). Highest protein content was
      obtained from treatment C (33.48), followed by B (31.96), A (31.83), then K+ and
      KG (31.77). Highest lipid content was also obtained by treatment C (8.32),
      followed by A (7.01), B (6.94), then K+ and KG (5.88).</p>
      <p><b>Total bacterial population: </b>Bacterial population was measured once a
      week during 42 days experiment. Bacterial population during treatment was
      dynamics, for all treatments were ranging from 105 up to 108 CFU mLG1, from
      initial to the final stage of experiment. </p>
      <p>During initial stage, total bacteria was ranging between 105-107 CFU mLG1,
      whileduring final stage, total bacterial population was 106-108 CFU mLG1. It was
      indicated that totalbacterial population from all treatments was not much
      different. </p>
      <p><b>Observation on water quality:</b> Water quality parameters observed in the
      study were includingof temperature, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), pH, Total Ammonia
      Nitrogen (TAN), nitrite and nitrate.Those were measured once every 7 days on
      catfish culture media.</p>
