      <h3>Biofloc System</h3>
      <p>The biofloc system was developed under the same principle that regular waste
      water treatment plants have, in which the microbes grow from feces of the
      cultured organisms being, transforming it into less complex organic products
      that can be consumed by other organisms and return to the food chain (Avnimelech
      &amp; Kochba, 2009). </p>
      <p>In aquaculture, the “biofloc” system acts like a retention trap for the
      nutrients in the pond, and reduces maintenance costs because it can be used as
      food supplement for the commercial organisms being cultured, which provides an
      added value by improving the food consumption rate (Azim &amp; Little, 2008).</p>
      <p>The term “biofloc” applies to a compound made out of 60 to 70% of organic
      matter, which includes a heterogeneous mixture of microorganisms (fungus, algae,
      protozoans, and rotifers) and of 30 – 40% of inorganic matter such as colloids,
      organic polymers, and dead cells. </p>
      <p>They can reach a size up to 1000 µm, irregular shape, full of pores, and
      allow the pass of fluids (Chu &amp; Lee 2004).</p>
      <p>To stablish the BFT is necessary that the pond has a cover that prevents the
      accumulation of solid organic matter at the bottom, adding carbon sources that
      stimulates the growth of heterotrophic bacteria, and to keep constant aeration
      in the water column, which will help the combination of physical, chemical, and
      biological factors required for the floc formation (Azim &amp; Little, 2008;
      Emerenciano com pers 2010).</p>
