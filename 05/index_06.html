      <h3>Conclusions</h3>
      <p>To establish the biofloc technology provides benefits to the production
      systems, such as lowering the density of the toxic components that can affect
      the culture, it can also help reducing or eliminated the water exchange in the
      ponds, which is of great help when there is shortage of water; also help to
      avoid contamination, since improve the water health due to the heterotrophic
      bacteria that inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria, reducing the
      possibilities toinfect the organisms preventing contagion and massive deceases.
      </p>
      <p>The optimal use of the nutrients by the biofloc bacterias, diminish the cost
      of food, for the fish flour that is consumed in large amounts in the world and
      its availability sometimes is scarce and get high costs. This system permit to
      the production farms not to be dependent since the biofloc can work as food when
      the feed prices become too high. </p>
      <p>The biofloc in the ponds allows an increase in populations of the cultured
      organisms, and thus the harvests intensify without increasing the amount of
      space that can be for other activities. </p>
      <p>The future of this system is very promissory because it can help to get high
      productions required to satisfy the growing human population needs. </p>
      <p>Another advantage in the use of the biofloc system is the decline of the
      production costs, this is not only beneficial for producers but it could allow
      the access of more people to this source of animal protein, and improve of human
      being with scarce economic resources. </p>
