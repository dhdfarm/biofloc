      <h3>Biofloc Systems: A Technological Breakthrough in Aquaculture</h3>
      <p>To increase aquaculture production, problems related to this activity like
      increasing the area required for the facility, water conduction carriage and
      building ponds drains for residual water must be resolved. </p>
      <p>Introduction of exotic species has created a risk by provoking the transition
      of new microbes and diseases to local organisms (De Schryver et al. 2008;
      Emerenciano et al. 2011; FAO, 2010). </p>
      <p>On intensive aquaculture business the highest production cost is feeding the
      organisms, that added to the fact that around 60% of it is wasted by the
      organisms, which causes phosphorus, carbon, nitrogen, to name some, to prevail
      in water as suspended matter or dissolved chemicals or are expelled from the
      system by gasification or water change polluting other water bodies and near-by
      soils producing economic losses to producers (Gutierrez-Wing &amp; Malone, 2006). .</p>
      <p>One alternative to reduce the environmental damages caused by aquaculture and
      to optimize production is the usage of the “Biofloc” Technology (BFT), this
      technology was developed in the 70’s, and it is based in the microbial
      communities that help minimize or avoid water exchange and, as an additional
      benefit, the production of microbial protein that can be used as food
      (Avnimelech, 2009a).</p>
