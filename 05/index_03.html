      <h3>Biofloc Development</h3>
      <p>To develop the bioflocs, biological polymers substances are required to keep
      the components together, creating a matrix that encapsulate the cells. This
      matrix protects the microorganisms from their predators, provides direct access
      to nutrients and works as substrate (De Schryer et al. 2008). </p>
      <p>Species biodiversity that inhabit the flocs depends on the microbiota found
      in the water body; some of them may function as biological control agents
      against pathogens through competitive exclusion or due to probiotic capabilities
      (Ray et al. 2010a). </p>
      <p>However, to achieve the establishment of heterotrophic bacteria in the
      biofloc, it is necessary to adjust the carbon/nitrogen (C:N) relation in the
      water body, and is required around 20 units of carbon to assimilate one nitrogen
      unit, this is obtained by adding a food of low protein and one carbohydrate such
      as molasses in sufficient amount (Avnimelech 1999a; Emerenciano com pers. 2011).
      </p>
      <p>When this rate is adequate, bacteria that grow inside of the microsystem
      starts to use compounds that can be toxic to the culture such as organic carbon,
      ammoniac nitrogen, nitrates, nitrites, and phosphates as energy sources,
      oxidizing them so algae, fungi, and other bacteria and filtering organisms can
      use them (Avnimelech 1999a; Avnimelech 2007). </p>
      <p>The non-consumed nitrogen by the organisms in the culture can be used to
      produce microbe protein, instead of generating toxic compounds which also helps
      controlling toxic inorganic nitrogen, residual food, and the rest of the
      phytoplankton production will also be broken down into simpler compounds
      (Avnimelech 1999b). </p>
      <p>It is very important to note that this process reduces the total amount of
      dissolved oxygen available for the organisms, so the existence of an adequate
      concentration of this element in the water becomes very important (Abarz√∫a et
      al. 1995; Avnimelech 1999a; Mc Graw 2003). </p>
      <p>Proliferation of bacterial colonies and microorganisms generates an increase
      in the biofloc biomass, it increase must have a density between 10 and 15 mL so
      the system can keep functioning properly. </p>
      <p>The excessive can be used as source of protein for the organisms, sometimes
      directly or in the form of flour or feed (Avnimelech 1999a; De Schiver et al.
      2008; Emerenciano com pers. 2011)</p>
